woof 13600k sounds like a fantastic chip weve got one inhouse and will be putting something a little special together with it in the coming weeks keep them eyes peeled,0.0020000000949949026,0.013000000268220901,0.9850000143051147
this is very good ill be pairing the i513600k with an msi b760m motherboard and they look to be all ddr4 based,0.0020000000949949026,0.01899999938905239,0.9789999723434448
the 13600k looks to be really promising for 300 it might be the go to cpu for higher end pc builds,0.003000000026077032,0.023000000044703484,0.9750000238418579
thanks for your review today on the #13900k anxiously awaiting the #13600k as that is the value buy great for 90 of gamers ,0.003000000026077032,0.024000000208616257,0.972000002861023
exactly the 13600k is such a good cpu chip you get 6p cores and 8e cores having pe cores is such a brilliant idea but the e cores even turbo up to 4ghz so theyre still very very capable cores plus 20 threads too just a very good cpu,0.007000000216066837,0.024000000208616257,0.9700000286102295
the i5 13600k is looking really good,0.003000000026077032,0.027000000700354576,0.9700000286102295
oh yeah cant wait for rtx 406013600k combo for sub 1500 pc,0.0020000000949949026,0.029999999329447746,0.9679999947547913
ill have hopefully the best 13th gen review live shortly after launch expect stock oc results for the 12900k 13900k and 13600k the focus will be true unbottlenecked performance and value,0.0020000000949949026,0.03200000151991844,0.9660000205039978
not only the value crown the performance king cant wait to see 13600k and the rest of the i5 lineup destroy amds zen 4 lineup,0.004000000189989805,0.029999999329447746,0.9660000205039978
indeed i think im gonna go with the i5 13600k i have a 3060ti and i believe paired with that will be great 40 series is espensiveeeee,0.003000000026077032,0.03099999949336052,0.9660000205039978
 loved the i5 13600k review im trying to upgrade from i5 2500k finally and was wondering what aircooler you recommend for 13600k,0.0020000000949949026,0.032999999821186066,0.9639999866485596
13600k 5950x is even better to see,0.004000000189989805,0.03999999910593033,0.9559999704360962
well done intel 13600k plus a770 plus ddr4 build of my choice,0.004000000189989805,0.0430000014603138,0.953000009059906
for real though the 13600k is the actual best chip here that thing has a priceperf unlike anything weve seen in years and the performance is bloody good for a sub300 cpu,0.017999999225139618,0.028999999165534973,0.953000009059906
the 13600k is in an interesting place too outperforming the 7700x what i just bought at a lower price point for a very good hybrid workload chip competition is nice to see compared to the preryzen days at any rate,0.004999999888241291,0.05700000002980232,0.9380000233650208
the 13600k is really good though,0.007000000216066837,0.057999998331069946,0.9350000023841858
the new 13600k from intel looks insane if i had the cash i would 100 swap over to socket lga 1200 using an older z690 chipset since you can flash the bios for 13th its looking like a good chip for a 5 year build especially with 7200 ddr5 support highest available as of now,0.007000000216066837,0.06599999964237213,0.9279999732971191
thanks the 13600k and the 5800x3d are the most costeffective options,0.00800000037997961,0.06599999964237213,0.9269999861717224
13600k is another great option,0.006000000052154064,0.07000000029802322,0.9240000247955322
definitely putting budget builds with 13600k and kf its too good to not do,0.009999999776482582,0.06800000369548798,0.9229999780654907
these i513600k reviews are looking so good still gonna wait for zen 4 x3d though,0.009999999776482582,0.07400000095367432,0.9169999957084656
even better than the 13600k 12700k same 20t but 8 p cores same price,0.00800000037997961,0.07900000363588333,0.9120000004768372
just finished the 13600k max oc benchmarks if you are a mid range buyer with a ddr4 setup dont hesitate to go buy this cpu it is probably the goat this generation,0.008999999612569809,0.08100000023841858,0.9110000133514404
no prob waiting for your 13600k review i think thatll be a way more interesting cpu for people to keep tabs on,0.006000000052154064,0.08500000089406967,0.9089999794960022
the benches from cb seemed to be accurate pcghnope cause biased the 13600k is a fantastic cpu for gamers especially they want to play at 1080p,0.009999999776482582,0.09000000357627869,0.8999999761581421
13600k z690 d4 mobo is the best deal this round imo,0.00800000037997961,0.09399999678134918,0.8989999890327454
however i will say the 13600k is getting some really good reviews,0.014000000432133675,0.09399999678134918,0.8920000195503235
the goat 13600k because it can be the sweet spot for the budget builds keep up mamen,0.00800000037997961,0.10199999809265137,0.8899999856948853
more impressive is 13600k,0.00800000037997961,0.10999999940395355,0.8830000162124634
old ram and mobo support is a huge w for intel i can use my ddr4 ram and i already secured z690 tomahawk ddr4 ready to buy 13600k ,0.006000000052154064,0.11100000143051147,0.8830000162124634
 s integrated gpus are quite something theres a quite a few games that are actually very playable on the intel® uhd graphics 770 probably because drivers are so cleanish i wonder if it performs better on the 13600k over my 12500 because of the cache difference,0.009999999776482582,0.11999999731779099,0.8700000047683716
i think it depends where you are now and what youre trying to do the i5 13600k is looking pretty damn good tbh,0.009999999776482582,0.11900000274181366,0.8700000047683716
more interesting to me at least is that the 13600k beats the mighty 7950x in these benchmarks,0.004000000189989805,0.1340000033378601,0.8619999885559082
my predictions on the 13600k were correct from the getgo wishfully this will force #amd to understand what it needs to do with zen v and onwards this level of render time is essential for the yellow collar industry #intel knew this and that is what will help it win this era,0.010999999940395355,0.17100000381469727,0.8180000185966492
i5 13600k looking to be the bang for the buck cpu this gen finally intel turning it around to amd this time looking to see what 13th gen mobile looking like and if framework plans on releasing a ddr4 mainboard for it because i mightve made the smart choice and wait out on 12th,0.007000000216066837,0.1850000023841858,0.8069999814033508
yep exactly 13600k is the real mvp of this gen plenty fast for games can reuse old boards and use cheap ddr4,0.017999999225139618,0.1770000010728836,0.8050000071525574
honestly the choice gamers have this gen is nuts 13600k with a decent b660 board and ddr4 will do 5ghzplus boosting on basic air cooling the 13700k for workstations and custom servers is fantastic value pros and cons for both amd and intel depending on what youre doing,0.028999999165534973,0.1679999977350235,0.8029999732971191
i7s are fruitful for sure but it appears therere almost 20 frames to be had any number better is going to better my cheap ass biscuit would chill with a 13600k to 13700k depending on how much single pc streaming headroom youd like and with 36005200 ram enjoy,0.032999999821186066,0.1679999977350235,0.7990000247955322
i have seen enough a core i05 is finally enough for production years after steve burke of gamers nexus stated that the tier was enough for gaming the #intel 13600k delivering ryzen 3950x5900xstyle workstation performance for the midrange makes it the true budget allaround,0.009999999776482582,0.20000000298023224,0.7900000214576721
13600k is really solid for gaming anything higher is for extra headroom or to help with multitasking or productivity cases such as editing streaming etc,0.014000000432133675,0.19900000095367432,0.7860000133514404
13600k ddr4 review would be nice,0.014000000432133675,0.20000000298023224,0.7860000133514404
after using a 1600af since 2020 i think im going to jump over to intel in all honesty i want to go all out and make a pc build thatll last and i am absolutely going to buy a z790 motherboard and an i5 13600k once they drop to sub 300,0.014999999664723873,0.20100000500679016,0.7839999794960022
benchmark 13600k is a big threat to zen4 so would love to see those numbers,0.017000000923871994,0.20999999344348907,0.7730000019073486
for cpu amd ryzen 5 5600x beats amd ryzen 7600x in terms of power consumption and besides amd ryzen 5 5600x is way better than intel core i5 13600k not by performance but power consumption low power consumption is king not performance,0.027000000700354576,0.20200000703334808,0.7710000276565552
its also differentiating the 13600k as a good allrounder and the 13900k as a cpu with a lot of efficiency potential,0.010999999940395355,0.22699999809265137,0.7620000243186951
because the 13600k only cost a little more and its a much better all round cpu,0.03700000047683716,0.21199999749660492,0.7509999871253967
i9 is good deal and bad at the same time even with 360mm aio it runs way hotter 13600k is absolutely one of best cpu released by intel but the pricing is way higher than its msrp atleast in my region same goes for new am5 cpus better wait for ces to see what both offers,0.07599999755620956,0.19200000166893005,0.7319999933242798
13600k and a ddr4 z690 board would be the best bang for buck use the same ram as they were using on the z370 platform and all they need is boardproc,0.02199999988079071,0.25699999928474426,0.7210000157356262
amd will need to drop the prices of the 7000 series cpus otherwise intel 13th gen is much better overall value the i513600k at 300 is much better value than amds 7600x and 7700x and is cheaper to boot nice to have competition again,0.039000000804662704,0.25099998712539673,0.7099999785423279
even the 13600k should provide better lowsframetimes than the x3d wonder how it stacks up if you pair the i5 with ddr4 not hating on the x3d its an easy upgrade and good choice for many i would not pick it for a new system though or if you do a lot besides games though,0.02800000086426735,0.2619999945163727,0.7099999785423279
get it 13600k is more interesting of a product to most people due to priceperformance it offers,0.02500000037252903,0.2720000147819519,0.703000009059906
if i had the money id make a 13600k rig its definitely the price to performance king in the current market,0.041999999433755875,0.2669999897480011,0.6919999718666077
glad you clarified italso pls include 13600k productivity tests with ddr4 alsoand not only in games,0.02500000037252903,0.2930000126361847,0.6819999814033508
any of us who either opted for haswellbroadwell xeons skylake x 7000 series original zen threadripper or a zen ii or iii ryzen 09 cpu has awaited the day that this performance would meet the midrange #intels 13600k delivers an option i can recommend for this entire decade,0.014000000432133675,0.3100000023841858,0.6759999990463257
not a fanboy 13600k is good same with 7700x for amd gaming,0.041999999433755875,0.28200000524520874,0.6759999990463257
13600k the real king,0.027000000700354576,0.3179999887943268,0.6549999713897705
yes the 13900k will be faster than the 12900k but i really think the focus should be on the value the 13600k brings i will pay special attention to this in my review,0.03500000014901161,0.32100000977516174,0.6439999938011169
without jumping ship from a existing am4 platform i still thing the 5800x3d is a hell of a deal for existing am4 platforms that are on zen or zen plus but going forward if you have a b660 chipset mobo or even a more lowend z690 13600k is a quality upgrade if continued,0.023000000044703484,0.3409999907016754,0.6359999775886536
it would be great if after you finish benchmarking all rpl cpus you put them all vs adl in a single chart with ddr4 vs ddr5 at 1080p showing the difference im mostly interested in the perf difference between 13600k ddr4 vs 13700k ddr4 vs 13700k ddr5 in 1 lows,0.013000000268220901,0.3619999885559082,0.6240000128746033
the #intel corei5 13600k might just be the new gaming king if only lga1700 wasnt eol after this generation,0.04500000178813934,0.3319999873638153,0.621999979019165
yeah 13600k is a champ,0.024000000208616257,0.3779999911785126,0.5979999899864197
yes i will be playing at 4k i dont see the need for anything over 13600k and i wanna max this cpu out by giving it the best possible ram i upgrade every year so next year i can always grab meteor lake,0.061000000685453415,0.37400001287460327,0.5649999976158142
still 13600k is best now,0.032999999821186066,0.41100001335144043,0.5559999942779541
ah gotcha i remember seeing the igpu in task manager and thought nothing of it so guessing it was all good i got 1300 for 13900k and 1100 for 13600k 3090 ti not sure if i can compare with you as you did the extended test which i assume scores differently,0.03500000014901161,0.4359999895095825,0.5289999842643738
true for high end the mid range i refuse to call a 300 dollar chip low end is actually pretty efficient and more than enough for most users 13600k is apparently nuts 7600x is also phenomenal or if you dont wanna break the bank a simple 5600 and cheap b550 board ,0.14499999582767487,0.33799999952316284,0.5170000195503235
13600k might be the mvp,0.04100000113248825,0.4480000138282776,0.5109999775886536
i mean if your budget allows for 13600k youll get better gaming performance even compared to 12900k,0.041999999433755875,0.44699999690055847,0.5109999775886536
we did 13600k with ddr43600cl14 today on average its 2 percent but there are some games where its even faster,0.017999999225139618,0.47200000286102295,0.5090000033378601
yea but then the 7700x is fine so are the high end for gaming id still probably buy the 7600x for the upgrade path over th 13600k but if i did productivity work the 13th for sure,0.02199999988079071,0.47099998593330383,0.5070000290870667
because 13600k sits in between those 2 just slightly more expensive than 7600x and a little bit cheaper than the 7700x but it will most likely smash both ,0.041999999433755875,0.4580000042915344,0.49900001287460327
just gamees can get a 13600k or even the kf varient gaming perf is almost identical and sometimes it also beats the i9,0.03799999877810478,0.47699999809265137,0.48399999737739563
i mean if youre really gonna compare fps like that just take a look at the 13600k probably cheaper and still performs pretty identical to the i9 in games whilst also having excellent oc headroom and more threads than 5800x3d,0.06800000369548798,0.45500001311302185,0.47699999809265137
13600k is the ideal price to performance cpu right now you dont need a 13900k at all for gaming,0.10599999874830246,0.42800000309944153,0.4659999907016754
really curious how the 13600k with ddr4 b660 and 3080ti performs as im looking into buying that,0.01899999938905239,0.531000018119812,0.45100000500679016
kinda stuck between buying 13600k and 13700k i know core i5 is already good enough but core i5 gives me midrange vibes i want to have a core i7 so i can say my pc is high end ,0.12200000137090683,0.43799999356269836,0.4410000145435333
the bot inside me does hunger for ipc information keen to see cheaper 13600k vs 12th gen10th gen numbers just for shits n giggles thanks for purchasing it for viewer query and thanks to your supporters #redhamner ,0.1940000057220459,0.367000013589859,0.4390000104904175
lets see tomorrow how i5 13600k scores 24k in cinebench r23 this cpu is going to become yet another most people choice like 12600k in 2021,0.03200000151991844,0.5360000133514404,0.4320000112056732
seems fine in term of pricing only 200€ more for 13600k and ddr5 im accounting for the price difference between your cooler and mine,0.035999998450279236,0.5329999923706055,0.4309999942779541
lets see if amd can do something more about the price i guess i will still recommend 13600k to my brother because he is more of a low budget pc owner and can keep his ddr4 will still be big upgrade from 3600x even with old ram i guess,0.029999999329447746,0.550000011920929,0.41999998688697815
liked 13600k ngl,0.04500000178813934,0.5450000166893005,0.41100001335144043
if youre set on 4k gaming a 13600k or a 7600x paired with a 4090 will give you every bit of performance a 2x more expensive 7950x or 13900k will,0.07800000160932541,0.5189999938011169,0.40400001406669617
i just ordered a 13600k to replace my 10700 paired with my existing 3090 and ddr4 32g 3200mhz gonna be doing a before and after benchmark 1440p and see what kinda gains i get 13th intel is pretty nuts so is the amd 7000s,0.039000000804662704,0.5709999799728394,0.38999998569488525
okay ive made my decision ill get a i513600k and keep my ddr43000 i have a dedicated editing rig 5945wx so this is really just for gaming,0.03200000151991844,0.5789999961853027,0.3889999985694885
so the 13600k is well in the range of it mattering because its only 340 dollars ditto the 12700k at 380 dollars and the 7600x at 300 dollars and the 7700x at 39999 so the chart does matter,0.014999999664723873,0.6110000014305115,0.37400001287460327
man that 300 dollar 13600k is rippin,0.16300000250339508,0.46299999952316284,0.37400001287460327
not yet plan to do it on the core i513600k which is shaping up to be the cpu of the year,0.04100000113248825,0.5920000076293945,0.367000013589859
 destroy is a big word its a bit better in some games if paired with ddr5 otherwise its a trade of blows outside gaming yeah 13700k have some advantages but speaking of low cost cpu i would rather suggest the 13600k,0.17599999904632568,0.4580000042915344,0.3659999966621399
oh man now i want a 13600k,0.19599999487400055,0.44200000166893005,0.3619999885559082
i guess so yeah but it should definitely beat a 12700k13600k at 65w,0.028999999165534973,0.6190000176429749,0.35199999809265137
i think 13600k would be better buy than 7600x if the price is same,0.04100000113248825,0.621999979019165,0.3370000123977661
they gave a summary of the 13900k for the 13600k so it enjoys all the same results huh,0.035999998450279236,0.6290000081062317,0.335999995470047
now that convinced me to buy a 13600k,0.06599999964237213,0.6010000109672546,0.33399999141693115
13600k dethroned 7600x that was quick,0.04600000008940697,0.6320000290870667,0.3230000138282776
id rather go 13600k with ddr4 and get a 4090 this setup will be enough to get the most of of 4090 at 4k,0.10599999874830246,0.5730000138282776,0.32100000977516174
13600k is a nobrainer unless amd comes with 7800x3d at something like 400 to offer better mt and gaming perf compared to 13600k and better gaming performance compared to 13700k 7600x should be priced at something like 250,0.08100000023841858,0.6000000238418579,0.3199999928474426
yea i might upgrade to the i513600k,0.010999999940395355,0.6740000247955322,0.3149999976158142

13600k is insane value basically makes everything else ryzen 7000 or core 13th gen seem pointless for anyone who doesnt earn a living from having a faster nt machine my recommendation for new builds was made easy thanks to intel lol,0.3659999966621399,0.3370000123977661,0.296999990940094
cpu of the year 13600k for sure i think amd should have a divergence in ccds like a 16c variant for desktop they could pack all cores in one chiplet to avoid crossccd latencies so the center is a monolithic core complex adv packaging with io around it,0.05000000074505806,0.6740000247955322,0.2759999930858612
yeah came to the same conclusion in his 13600k oc video i think it should be easy for pretty much any 13600k and up rpls cpu to do ddr44000 in g1 or ddr58000 in g2 even with dualrank sticksconfigs without pushing vccsa to dangerous levels,0.057999998331069946,0.6710000038146973,0.27000001072883606
when will we see your tests and please tell me youre gonna do ddr4 max tune vs ddr5 too also which cpus im mostly interested in 13600k 13700k do you have those,0.00800000037997961,0.7229999899864197,0.26899999380111694
when zen4 launched i said no reason to upgrade with rpl i believe the same but raptor gives a little more reason to upgrade than raphael especially 13600k,0.07100000232458115,0.6620000004768372,0.2669999897480011

 16 note the price difference between the i513600k and the i713700k is far less than the price difference between the i713700k and the i513900k its only a small jump from the i5 to the i7 and you get 2 extra pcores but a huge jump to the i9 with no more ps,0.0860000029206276,0.6579999923706055,0.25600001215934753
annihilates the 7600x is cheaper by £60 than the 13600k has a better overall average in games doesnt thermal throttle so stop with the inaccurate clickbait titles,0.2800000011920929,0.47200000286102295,0.24899999797344208

of course 7700x would win against 13600k its on different price level intel still the winning this round,0.05000000074505806,0.7089999914169312,0.2409999966621399

thanks i typically dont open those since my german is pretty basic it seems the 7700x matches well the 13600k slightly below but will probably get even closer if am5s support for faster ddr5 matures but even as of today close enough,0.10000000149011612,0.6690000295639038,0.23199999332427979
i was watching through some intel 13th gen reviews amd 7xxx is basically unreccomendable if you care about value at all if you have an am4 board get a 5800x3d otherwise the 13600k is such a good value incredible gaming cpu and punches above its weight in productivity,0.3569999933242798,0.414000004529953,0.2290000021457672
on a cost vs performance this is a wise choice but also maybe look at 13600k that thing is kak mooi,0.11500000208616257,0.6629999876022339,0.22200000286102295
my overclocked 12600k with ddr4 beats the 7700x cant imagine the 13600k slaughter,0.23199999332427979,0.5490000247955322,0.2199999988079071
thing is u can run ddr4 3200 on 12gen lga boards with a 13600k and smash a 5800x3d,0.03700000047683716,0.7440000176429749,0.2199999988079071
maybe if they gave us free x670e 79x 32gb ddr5 with purchase of n31 think thats about the only i could be bothered with am5 currently 13600k is crazy value btw,0.210999995470047,0.5709999799728394,0.21799999475479126
13600k first to keep you busy until 13900k ,0.004999999888241291,0.7820000052452087,0.21299999952316284
is it good for 1440p gaming i mean i play mostly warzone so im thinking about 30703070ti with some bdie rams ddr4 is the 13600k enough my goal is steady 120fps 1440p what do u think,0.04399999976158142,0.7459999918937683,0.20999999344348907
anyway what you recommend to me for playing very high refresh rate 1080p esport in apex legends ive heard that in esport 1080p 13600k would be better but in 1440p 5800x3d or the 7600x would be better im wrong,0.13199999928474426,0.6610000133514404,0.20600000023841858

right now if you need a gaming cpu upgrade get a 5800x3d if on am4 and get a 13600k if youre on lga1700 or building a new system if you need absolutely topend gaming performance wait a few months for zen 4 3d to drop ignore the entire zen 4 lineup unless price drops,0.125,0.6779999732971191,0.19699999690055847
oh and just to clarify im not saying all prebuilds are bad some of the omen system for example are great you just need to do some research first you dont want to be buying a 13900k for example and getting the performance of a 13600k out of it ,0.3919999897480011,0.41499999165534973,0.19300000369548798
4k beat 1080p because some people just want to know they dont lose too much when they get that cpu says they may want 13600k that may only lose 2 fps in 4k gaming compared to 5800x3d or 7600x but better in other ways,0.1979999989271164,0.6110000014305115,0.19099999964237213
might be going for a 13600k and see how much i can push it with ddr4,0.02199999988079071,0.7919999957084656,0.1860000044107437
im not saying buy a core2duo with a 4090 no buy a 12600k13600k7600x5600x instead of buying a 24 core 16 core processors rather put more money towards your gpu instead the performance upgrade will be much more worth it,0.18199999630451202,0.6330000162124634,0.1850000023841858
the increase in cache on the 13700k might be worth looking at if your use case would use it but yeah 13600k is where its at just find a way to cool those lil heat sources seems like nhd15 or a 240 clc,0.11100000143051147,0.7099999785423279,0.17900000512599945

hi what is better for running esport 360hz titles r5 7600x 13600k or 5800x3d frequency are more important for playing high hertz or its better to have 3d cache,0.04399999976158142,0.8259999752044678,0.12999999523162842

no am4 board here in terms of pure cost 13600k mobo is lessor in price than a new am4 board and cpu and in most cases intel wins that race looking forward to see what zen4 might have in the realmm of a 7800x3d but expect price will be horrible plus will require pricey ddr5,0.44999998807907104,0.4350000023841858,0.11500000208616257

the performance numbers on the 13600kkf are absolutely wild for its price point amd is in trouble i513600kkf is the go to gaming processor performs just as well and sometimes marginally better than the 13900k at 8core gaming bm and outperforms all am5 offerings,0.640999972820282,0.24799999594688416,0.11100000143051147

7600x is margin of error gaming perf vs 13600k the difference is irrelevant when 3d drops well have to reanalyze the situation then since lisa su is unlikely going to sell it to gamers for cheap,0.5529999732971191,0.42100000381469727,0.026000000536441803

hey in your 13600k review you seem to have made a small mistake at the cost per frame screen you seem to bill the same price for 6000ghz and 6400ghz ram on both there is a signifikant difference where i live and i can imagine that the price is the same anywhere,0.5799999833106995,0.3970000147819519,0.023000000044703484

i dont really care though this is about the best not the biggest value if we want to argue value both the 7950x and 13900k lose horrifically 13600k vs 7700x would be the discussion,0.7200000286102295,0.257999986410141,0.023000000044703484

what are you talking about the intel review kit contains both a 13900k and 13600k so reviewers can either review them both or one of them depending on their choosing please dont spread misinfo,0.3630000054836273,0.6159999966621399,0.020999999716877937
for example i have a rtx 3080 and a 5600x its not easy to find if an upgrade to a 5800x3d or even the new 13600k would help in 4k ,0.7049999833106995,0.2750000059604645,0.019999999552965164

i dont think its worth upgrading personally 12600k has most of the performance of a 13600k and will use less power on average,0.7739999890327454,0.20800000429153442,0.017000000923871994
why would i even bother with a ryzen 7 5800x3d 8 cores 34 to 45ghz 400 when i can get a core i513600k for 329 the i513600k destroys most of the last gen ryzens 14 cores 20 threads 35 to 510ghz unlocked so that deal for 20 off ryzen 7 5800x3d isnt that great,0.8100000023841858,0.17399999499320984,0.01600000075995922
that doesnt make sense the 13900k didnt beat the 7950 or the 7700 by alot in some cases they trade blows game to game so this would mean that the 13600k would either tie or beat the 13900k which automatically makes the 13900k redundant in gaming vs the 13600k,0.6349999904632568,0.3499999940395355,0.01600000075995922
13600k is £60 more expensive than the 7600x in the uk that is not a similar price,0.7279999852180481,0.25699999928474426,0.014999999664723873
okay this explains why the gap is bigger still other reviews show the 13600k being slower than the 7950x which you can not explain with this,0.6370000243186951,0.34700000286102295,0.014999999664723873
like i said youre upset you made a bad purchase and got a more expensive lesser performing chip but have fun knowing 13600k beats 7900x ,0.8299999833106995,0.1550000011920929,0.014999999664723873
the hardware itself isnt more capable it is weaker rather console devs have lower level api access and no choice but to optimize well but make no mistake no optimization can equalize vs a 7700x or 13600k,0.8220000267028809,0.16300000250339508,0.014999999664723873
why are the colors turning red at different values on 12th vs 13th gen on 12th it turns red at 4849ns and on 13th gen at 54 ns for the 13600k and 65 ns on the 13900k makes it kind of hard to compare from coloring alone,0.45500001311302185,0.531000018119812,0.014000000432133675
makes no sense to me to take conclusions from a value chart which ignores price drops that can wildly skew the results imo there are only a few cpus anyone should be buying the 5600 5700x 13600k 5800x3d or 7950x zen 4 x3d chips are coming to kill 13th gen i7i9 for gaming,0.7889999747276306,0.19699999690055847,0.014000000432133675

13700k 3600 drops from 483 to 501 and also drops two ranks from where it currently is in the 13600k video the error is in both the 13600k and 13700k videos,0.6370000243186951,0.3499999940395355,0.013000000268220901

the ryzen 5 7600x might unironically be one of the worst cpus these past few gens and one of amds worst msdt offerings since bulldozer just based on how badly the i513600k is about to shit on it theres as much of a reason to buy it as there was to buy the i711700k,0.9160000085830688,0.0729999989271164,0.010999999940395355
