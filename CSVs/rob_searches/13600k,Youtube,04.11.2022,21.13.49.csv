awesome job intel i have to say the 13600k impresses me a heck of a lot more than the 13900k the 13900k may be able to do much better overall but the value proposition on the 13600k is absurdly good was not expecting this level of a generational improvement aside from power and thermals and apparently neither was amd,0.009999999776482582,0.019999999552965164,0.9700000286102295

holy shit the 5800x3d is on par with the 13600k ddr5 6400 in the 12 game average thats incredibly impressive and means that if youre already on am4 getting a 5800x3d is the way to go,0.006000000052154064,0.02800000086426735,0.9670000076293945

really impressed with how often and how close the 13600k scores near the 5950x thats an i5 vs amds last gen halo crazy,0.003000000026077032,0.03400000184774399,0.9629999995231628
gamers nexus is the boys to go to if youre looking to upgrade very detailed and very informative much appreciated im upgrading from i5 9600k to 13600k,0.004000000189989805,0.03799999877810478,0.9580000042915344
really excited for the 13600k i know youre busy but when you get a chance it would be nice to know if the contact frames from the 12th gen still work with the 13th gen and if they give the same temperature reduction as with the 12th gen,0.003000000026077032,0.041999999433755875,0.9539999961853027
i love seeing my 12100f in the charts i was eyeing a 12600k a few months back now that intels the good guy and my h610ma d4 supports 13th gen im looking more towards 13600kf instead long as i can run my ddr4 at 3200mhz we gucci,0.006000000052154064,0.04100000113248825,0.953000009059906
the 13600k is the best cpu in a lot of generations imo since the 3600 maybe even better since the multithreading is nipping at the r9s heels,0.009999999776482582,0.03999999910593033,0.949999988079071
the real story here for me is seeing the i6 13600k besting or on part with he i7 12700k i was looking at buying that i7 but ended up going with the new i5 13600k and i have been super happy with the build,0.003000000026077032,0.04899999871850014,0.9480000138282776
the 13700k just looks like a great price to performance chip slotted right in the perfect price if you need the extra p cores but the 13600k might be a steal honestly,0.008999999612569809,0.04600000008940697,0.9449999928474426
yup definitely upgrading my i5 6600k to the 13600k now what to upgrade my 980ti to hopefully amd shows some good things on nov 3rd,0.0020000000949949026,0.05400000140070915,0.9440000057220459
intel 13th gen supporting ddr4 is actually huge i might actually consider getting a 13600k now,0.004999999888241291,0.05400000140070915,0.9409999847412109
i love how this gen just beating 12900k for fun i wonder when i get upgrade from 2666v3 like amd 1700 in single 3600x in multi 2600 in gaming if 14600k will beat 13600k and how they do it,0.004999999888241291,0.057999998331069946,0.9369999766349792
the 13600k is holding up better in production workloads than i expected which is making me kinda tempted to consider it i think im still going to wait for now but this is definitely a stronger showing from intel than i expected,0.007000000216066837,0.05999999865889549,0.9330000281333923
its nice to see 13600k isnt power hungry like the 13900kstill very happy with my 5800x3d,0.010999999940395355,0.05900000035762787,0.9309999942779541
it may be time to upgrade my i76700 soon the 13600k is looking like a pretty good upgrade target,0.004000000189989805,0.07100000232458115,0.925000011920929
these new cpus is making upgrading from my 6850k wicked attractive ill probably wait to see what he 13700k has in store though especially given the 13600k is pretty much on par with the 12900k in gaming,0.006000000052154064,0.07100000232458115,0.9229999780654907
the 13600k is really starting to look like the next 2500k this cpu will almost certainly be more than good enough for aaa games going into the 2030s,0.004999999888241291,0.07500000298023224,0.9190000295639038
coming from an i78700k the i513600k is looking pretty good right now,0.006000000052154064,0.07999999821186066,0.9139999747276306
arg the options are too good now im planning a system upgrade from skylake was thinking of going 7700x but now the 13600k is swaying me since it beats the amd part in almost every test,0.009999999776482582,0.08900000154972076,0.9020000100135803
please do some tests in gaming for 13600k ddr4 vs ddr5 also an igpu tests would be nice great review btw ,0.006000000052154064,0.10000000149011612,0.8939999938011169
intel definitely made a good choice to pack 8 e cores with the 13600k its basically a 14 core 20 thread cpu and thats why it beats the 7600x so easily in the productivity aspect,0.012000000104308128,0.09799999743700027,0.8899999856948853
"great content the 13600k looks like a great performer

however for the platform comparison it wouldve been fair to add intel with ddr5 too as i would presume many people would buy a new system today with ddr5 instead of ddr4",0.008999999612569809,0.10700000077486038,0.8840000033378601

intels ecores are a blessing for rendering and productivity where they can be used to great extent for gaming theyre not as valuable but can be used for other background things especially because there are only 6 performance cores for the i513600k which can then be focused for gaming,0.02199999988079071,0.15800000727176666,0.8199999928474426
could we see the second coming of one of the greatest cpus of all time the 2500k def seems that way id be interested in oc numbers on the 13600k and how far you can push it,0.007000000216066837,0.17800000309944153,0.8159999847412109
i am really super curious about cooling the 13600k what air cooler would you pair it with and what aio would you pair it with if you could pick just one in each category looking always at price vs performance thanks,0.009999999776482582,0.1809999942779541,0.8090000152587891
this solidifies my decision to buy a 13600k last time i upgraded my pc was 2016 most of the compute workload is on the gpu anyway so this cpu is a good deal it also doesnt have the insane power draw of some of the other intel cpus,0.02500000037252903,0.16699999570846558,0.8080000281333923
13600k would be a great drop in upgrade for i3 12100 users looking for more cpu performance,0.017999999225139618,0.1809999942779541,0.8009999990463257
jumping from a ryzen 3700x to the 13600k managed to grab a decent b660 mobo for cheap and will be reusing my current ram will ride this until ddr5 prices come down and see a path to upgrade mobo and ram and still bring cpu intel definitely winning the cost effective upgrade route,0.007000000216066837,0.1940000057220459,0.7979999780654907
basically it means that 13600k is future proof i can keep it and change a few generations of gpus like i did with my 2500k which serves me for 11 years now and is doing great with much younger gtx 1060,0.010999999940395355,0.19900000095367432,0.7900000214576721
lower the price of the 7700x to the level of the 13600k and make the 7600x a true budget option and amd gets a great market share,0.010999999940395355,0.2199999988079071,0.7689999938011169
so basically horizon brought the 7600x to the 13600k level i guess it could be because horizon was originally optimized for amd architecture from the get go for ps4 either way both cpus are pretty good,0.006000000052154064,0.2280000001192093,0.765999972820282
intel always won in gaming and amd in productivity now i see the 7600x narrowly winning in gaming and the 13600k in productivity on the other hand i have never seen a content creator that uses an i5 or a ryzen 5 they are more platforms for gamers,0.029999999329447746,0.25099998712539673,0.718999981880188
clearly a good photoshop machine here for a good price performance ratio is a 13600k or 7600x seeing the charts and the matter of power consumption and price well once amd lower the prices of everything hopefully as seems its the rumor,0.024000000208616257,0.28999999165534973,0.6850000023841858

i am going to build my first ever desktop on black friday ive always had laptops ive had a mental crush on the 5800x3d for so long the 13600k is compelling but i still worry that the next gen 3d variants from amd are going to be change the game once again ,0.07400000095367432,0.3230000138282776,0.6029999852180481
great review except the differnce in price here inthe uk between the 12600k and 13600k is £80 if you look at that you are probably better off with the 12600k despite the gains,0.07999999821186066,0.3230000138282776,0.597000002861023
you are wrong that the 3060 is a good test for this alot of folks are upgrading their old rigs or getting into pc gaming and will go for this 13600k due to the cost savings and overclock ability i plan to pair this with the rtx 4080 and will play nicely together i feel,0.04100000113248825,0.382999986410141,0.5759999752044678

hi i want to build a new computer this black friday i started thinking about it back in july so i decided that i wanted to go for the 5800x3d if the new cpus didnt impress me but looking at this am i better off with buying a 13600k for 70 more total price cpu mobo ram in my area,0.035999998450279236,0.40799999237060547,0.5559999942779541

"raptor lake has a potential for impressive efficiency if detuned der8auer made a video about 13900k yesterday where it lost 9 performance while drawing 50 less power becoming the most efficient high end cpu and if matched to powerdraw of 7950x outperforming it in most cases
the 13600k most likely has some but definitely less playroom",0.05999999865889549,0.4399999976158142,0.5009999871253967

without needing a huge suite of tests would love to see optimum power limits discovered for the 13600k 7600x 7700x 5800x3d for gaming maybe just 1 or 2 key benchmarks that track the overall mean well but then retested at different power limits to get some optimal power limits also showing efficiency and performance with those ,0.02800000086426735,0.5,0.47200000286102295
