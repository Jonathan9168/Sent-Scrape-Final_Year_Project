competition is great",0.004999999888241291,0.023000000044703484,0.9729999899864197
honestly last years i512600k was a beast and seeing this new i513600k is even better man thats insane,0.008999999612569809,0.01899999938905239,0.972000002861023
awesome job intel i have to say the 13600k impresses me a heck of a lot more than the 13900k the 13900k may be able to do much better overall but the value proposition on the 13600k is absurdly good was not expecting this level of a generational improvement aside from power and thermals and apparently neither was amd,0.009999999776482582,0.019999999552965164,0.9700000286102295

after watching your review of the ak620 2 months ago i bought it for a new build based on the 13600k this is a great combo i also installed a cpu contact frame i dont know if it makes a difference but it was an easy task and the temps look good",0.003000000026077032,0.02800000086426735,0.968999981880188

man you are awesome i am upgrading my ryzen 3700x to an 13600k and probably an ddr4 gigabyte board i can use my 32gb ddr4 ram and the 13600k is much faster than my 3700x you have gained a subscriber ,0.004999999888241291,0.028999999165534973,0.9660000205039978
my i512400 getting a score of 12400 in cinebench r23 multicore is already insane to me so the 13600k getting double that is absolutely mindblowing its very tempting to upgrade to the 13600k next summer when hopefully prices will have come down a bit by then,0.004999999888241291,0.03099999949336052,0.9639999866485596

gamers nexus is the boys to go to if youre looking to upgrade very detailed and very informative much appreciated im upgrading from i5 9600k to 13600k,0.004000000189989805,0.03799999877810478,0.9580000042915344
really excited for the 13600k i know youre busy but when you get a chance it would be nice to know if the contact frames from the 12th gen still work with the 13th gen and if they give the same temperature reduction as with the 12th gen,0.003000000026077032,0.041999999433755875,0.9539999961853027
i love seeing my 12100f in the charts i was eyeing a 12600k a few months back now that intels the good guy and my h610ma d4 supports 13th gen im looking more towards 13600kf instead long as i can run my ddr4 at 3200mhz we gucci,0.006000000052154064,0.04100000113248825,0.953000009059906
i had ryzen 5 1600 swapped 3 months ago to 12600k and i must say i am still impressed by 13600k and what intel pulled off here 12600k is still a beast even after 13th gen release,0.004999999888241291,0.0430000014603138,0.9520000219345093
i have the 13600kf and for me is the best cpu actually no expensive ddr4 support older chipset support and power enough for all games,0.00800000037997961,0.041999999433755875,0.949999988079071
the 13600k is the best cpu in a lot of generations imo since the 3600 maybe even better since the multithreading is nipping at the r9s heels,0.009999999776482582,0.03999999910593033,0.949999988079071
i feel like the 13600k data supports info that it has a lot of oc headroom which is quite cool,0.004000000189989805,0.04899999871850014,0.9470000267028809
yup definitely upgrading my i5 6600k to the 13600k now what to upgrade my 980ti to hopefully amd shows some good things on nov 3rd,0.0020000000949949026,0.05400000140070915,0.9440000057220459
the 13600k is holding up better in production workloads than i expected which is making me kinda tempted to consider it i think im still going to wait for now but this is definitely a stronger showing from intel than i expected,0.007000000216066837,0.05999999865889549,0.9330000281333923
13600k is a beast beating a 5800x3d 7000 series overall in gaming absolutely torching the 7600x58003dx in production work its only 299 at microcenter crazy good deal,0.010999999940395355,0.0560000017285347,0.9330000281333923
it may be time to upgrade my i76700 soon the 13600k is looking like a pretty good upgrade target,0.004000000189989805,0.07100000232458115,0.925000011920929
these new cpus is making upgrading from my 6850k wicked attractive ill probably wait to see what he 13700k has in store though especially given the 13600k is pretty much on par with the 12900k in gaming,0.006000000052154064,0.07100000232458115,0.9229999780654907
the 13600k is really starting to look like the next 2500k this cpu will almost certainly be more than good enough for aaa games going into the 2030s,0.004999999888241291,0.07500000298023224,0.9190000295639038
coming from an i78700k the i513600k is looking pretty good right now,0.006000000052154064,0.07999999821186066,0.9139999747276306
arg the options are too good now im planning a system upgrade from skylake was thinking of going 7700x but now the 13600k is swaying me since it beats the amd part in almost every test,0.009999999776482582,0.08900000154972076,0.9020000100135803
seems great im running a 3800x with a 3070 right now and id upgrade to the 13600k soon if i wouldnt have to change motherboards guess i have my next upgrade set for when my motherboard dies,0.008999999612569809,0.08900000154972076,0.9020000100135803
the only thing i learned from all this is that the 13600k lineup is going to be an absolute game changer when it comes to value,0.012000000104308128,0.0860000029206276,0.9020000100135803
please do some tests in gaming for 13600k ddr4 vs ddr5 also an igpu tests would be nice great review btw ,0.006000000052154064,0.10000000149011612,0.8939999938011169
intel definitely made a good choice to pack 8 e cores with the 13600k its basically a 14 core 20 thread cpu and thats why it beats the 7600x so easily in the productivity aspect,0.012000000104308128,0.09799999743700027,0.8899999856948853
i think i5 13600k would be much better than my currect i7 3770 planning to upgrade after so many years,0.013000000268220901,0.09799999743700027,0.8889999985694885
"great content the 13600k looks like a great performer

however for the platform comparison it wouldve been fair to add intel with ddr5 too as i would presume many people would buy a new system today with ddr5 instead of ddr4",0.008999999612569809,0.10700000077486038,0.8840000033378601

intels ecores are a blessing for rendering and productivity where they can be used to great extent for gaming theyre not as valuable but can be used for other background things especially because there are only 6 performance cores for the i513600k which can then be focused for gaming,0.02199999988079071,0.15800000727176666,0.8199999928474426
could we see the second coming of one of the greatest cpus of all time the 2500k def seems that way id be interested in oc numbers on the 13600k and how far you can push it,0.007000000216066837,0.17800000309944153,0.8159999847412109

jumping from a ryzen 3700x to the 13600k managed to grab a decent b660 mobo for cheap and will be reusing my current ram will ride this until ddr5 prices come down and see a path to upgrade mobo and ram and still bring cpu intel definitely winning the cost effective upgrade route,0.007000000216066837,0.1940000057220459,0.7979999780654907
"13600k is 2 cents more cost effective per frame

steve as you can see this chip clearly stomps all over everything and is the only choice for budget conscious gamers that will be all see you next time",0.020999999716877937,0.19200000166893005,0.7870000004768372
so i guess msi pro z690a whit a 13600k should be good for my next build,0.004999999888241291,0.22499999403953552,0.7699999809265137
lower the price of the 7700x to the level of the 13600k and make the 7600x a true budget option and amd gets a great market share,0.010999999940395355,0.2199999988079071,0.7689999938011169
so the best budget is the i5 13600k probably will be until next gen no matter what,0.012000000104308128,0.22100000083446503,0.7670000195503235
so basically horizon brought the 7600x to the 13600k level i guess it could be because horizon was originally optimized for amd architecture from the get go for ps4 either way both cpus are pretty good,0.006000000052154064,0.2280000001192093,0.765999972820282
hey great video do you think the i513600k can keep up with msi b660a pro if im not interested in overclocking,0.017999999225139618,0.21699999272823334,0.7649999856948853
theres a bundle deal on amazon right now for the gigabyte z690 aorus elite ax ddr4 intel core i512600k at 480 im so tempted as im still on an i510600k but i also really want the i513600k which would take it up to 530 i think for 50 more ill be happier with the 13th gen cpu and im keeping my great corsair dominator platinum dd4 memory of course,0.017999999225139618,0.2329999953508377,0.7490000128746033
i have to say that the 13900k is absolutely a hot chip and that its imo pretty unacceptable for cpus to thermally throttle out of the box the 13600k though it comes out looking absolutely phenomenal and appears to also be an overclocking beast,0.11400000005960464,0.1860000044107437,0.7009999752044678
clearly a good photoshop machine here for a good price performance ratio is a 13600k or 7600x seeing the charts and the matter of power consumption and price well once amd lower the prices of everything hopefully as seems its the rumor,0.024000000208616257,0.28999999165534973,0.6850000023841858
i am going to build my first ever desktop on black friday ive always had laptops ive had a mental crush on the 5800x3d for so long the 13600k is compelling but i still worry that the next gen 3d variants from amd are going to be change the game once again ,0.07400000095367432,0.3230000138282776,0.6029999852180481

without needing a huge suite of tests would love to see optimum power limits discovered for the 13600k 7600x 7700x 5800x3d for gaming maybe just 1 or 2 key benchmarks that track the overall mean well but then retested at different power limits to get some optimal power limits also showing efficiency and performance with those ,0.02800000086426735,0.5,0.47200000286102295
