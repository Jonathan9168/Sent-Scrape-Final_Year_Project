i have the 13600kf and is a very cool cpu i love it,0.004000000189989805,0.009999999776482582,0.9860000014305115
awesome job intel i have to say the 13600k impresses me a heck of a lot more than the 13900k the 13900k may be able to do much better overall but the value proposition on the 13600k is absurdly good was not expecting this level of a generational improvement aside from power and thermals and apparently neither was amd,0.009999999776482582,0.019999999552965164,0.9700000286102295
holy shit the 5800x3d is on par with the 13600k ddr5 6400 in the 12 game average thats incredibly impressive and means that if youre already on am4 getting a 5800x3d is the way to go,0.006000000052154064,0.02800000086426735,0.9670000076293945
thanks for doing this review another review i had watched yesterday arrived at the same conclusion about 13600k competition is great,0.004999999888241291,0.03200000151991844,0.9629999995231628
intel definitely made a good choice to pack 8 e cores with the 13600k its basically a 14 core 20 thread cpu and thats why it beats the 7600x so easily in the productivity aspect,0.012000000104308128,0.09799999743700027,0.8899999856948853

"hey guys
thank you for the amazing work
as you always advice i have watched reviews from multiple channels for the comparison between 7600x and 13600k
but these reviews use a 40903090ti to highlight the performance difference",0.012000000104308128,0.13300000131130219,0.8550000190734863
intels ecores are a blessing for rendering and productivity where they can be used to great extent for gaming theyre not as valuable but can be used for other background things especially because there are only 6 performance cores for the i513600k which can then be focused for gaming,0.02199999988079071,0.15800000727176666,0.8199999928474426

so basically horizon brought the 7600x to the 13600k level i guess it could be because horizon was originally optimized for amd architecture from the get go for ps4 either way both cpus are pretty good,0.006000000052154064,0.2280000001192093,0.765999972820282
hi i want to build a new computer this black friday i started thinking about it back in july so i decided that i wanted to go for the 5800x3d if the new cpus didnt impress me but looking at this am i better off with buying a 13600k for 70 more total price cpu mobo ram in my area,0.035999998450279236,0.40799999237060547,0.5559999942779541

just ordered a 5800x3d seems to be the only viable option if you dont want to pay the ddr5 tax 13600k would make sense if i planned for any cpu heavy professional use cases since i went all in for the gpu 4090 for machine learning i will pass on the halo cpu models,0.10700000077486038,0.6029999852180481,0.28999999165534973

sadly i got a 12600k for the htpc so cant justify getting a 13600k looking forward to the nonk raptor lake launches a 13400 on a z690 with ddr5 will be quite interesting,0.35199999809265137,0.41999998688697815,0.22699999809265137
steve i know you said youd opt to build an 13600k system if you needed to build new at this time and based on your testing i strongly agree but which memory type would you go for based on price to performance at this time,0.02800000086426735,0.7480000257492065,0.22499999403953552

hi steve very detailed review as always but ddr5 6400 is less than ddr5 6000 and mobo cost on 13600k changes with ram config are you using 2 different boards,0.15199999511241913,0.6549999713897705,0.19300000369548798
you can undervolt and overclock the 13600k and get lower temps than you do stock and itll get even higher fps here this is not the limit of the 13600k but pure stock keep this in mind,0.0689999982714653,0.7379999756813049,0.19300000369548798
"i wonder how much difference in performance there is in a typical midrange system lets say a ryzen 5600 rtx 3070 playing in story games in 1440p like horizon zd gow or a plagues tales

cmon steve this is far from annihilating the 13600k is def more versatile and well balanced but at that level im not too worried about productivity workloads 13600k is the overall better buy but i was expecting destruction lol,0.4490000009536743,0.3869999945163727,0.164000004529953
 also thinking about going i5 the cpu and mobo combos are either 650eur for a z79013600kf or 810eur z79013700kf 160eur saved on that alone the i5 would save on the mobo with going on a cheaper 14phase instead of the 16phase,0.04399999976158142,0.8119999766349792,0.14399999380111694
 you will be set on the cooler with that for sure here the 13600kf costs 379eur and the 13700kf is 499eur that is also the same that the b660 and z790 have different mostly have no idea what options you get on a lower end chipset never had a k series with a limited motherboard hope they still have power options to undervolt it,0.10199999809265137,0.765999972820282,0.13199999928474426
i know you guys worked hard on all this benchmarking probably exhausted but you got the core clocks comparison wrong for the i5 13600k at 220 i believe your previous i7 13700k review you had the core clocks wrong as well when showing specs nice job gents keep up the good benchmarks,0.5649999976158142,0.335999995470047,0.0989999994635582

i would like to see tests with a normal air cooler that alot of people would purchase 360 aio water coolers isnt realistic and massive air coolers isnt realistic either for alot of people both the 7600x and the 13600k would be more interesting with this kind of limitation,0.3720000088214874,0.5490000247955322,0.07900000363588333
the cost per frame graph is telling everything 13600k on ddr5 is the cheapest build for the maximum preformance all other builds are more expensive for at best same performance or negligible gains like 177 fps on a 7900x to 175 for the 13600k,0.515999972820282,0.41499999165534973,0.0689999982714653

i mean the 13600k is extremely good but i cant believe an i5 is throttling under a 360mm aio i asked intel about the throttling in their ama last time and they said there are many 280360mm aios on the market that can handle 260270w from raptor lake are they lying about that,0.6919999718666077,0.2460000067949295,0.06300000101327896

ok so taking just the currency rate that 330 bucks should tramslate to roughly 335 euros but the 13600k prices ive seen are typically around 445ish euros range that should be considered actual thievery p,0.19300000369548798,0.7580000162124634,0.05000000074505806

 lipp im exactly on the same spot comparing the prices just this very moment will reuse my 32gb ddr4 now its do i want to overlock or not overclocking will set me back another 200€ damn intel not letting b660 boards to overclock in the west do i go with z690 and 13600kf or b660 and 13700kf price is around the same 2 more power cores vs overclock,0.6779999732971191,0.29499998688697815,0.027000000700354576

thinking of b660 white strix board or z690 white strix the price difference is 150€ which is insane i wonder if its worth to overclock 13600k from my experience it wasnt worth to overclock 8086k even with 700mhz increase it didnt improve much if at all in games,0.7580000162124634,0.22300000488758087,0.01899999938905239
