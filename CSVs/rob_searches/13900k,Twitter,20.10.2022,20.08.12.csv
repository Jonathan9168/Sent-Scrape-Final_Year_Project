the 13900k actually exceeded my multicore expectations simply a better chip in every way,0.004999999888241291,0.023000000044703484,0.972000002861023

i love nzxt i did them for my first build but im using for my second build with a 13900k and a 4090 i definitely recommend powergpu as they have way more options to choose from and nzxts bld tends to take forever to replenish stock and they dont have as many parts,0.006000000052154064,0.03700000047683716,0.9570000171661377
update 7950x3d will be the best 5800x3d is probably the second best 13900k will probably beat normal 7000 chips marginally,0.004999999888241291,0.04699999839067459,0.9480000138282776
best benchmarks for the sim racers on the web kudos dan now someone get you 13900k by the end of the week and we are completely covered maybe bonus round of 5800x3d 4090 ,0.004000000189989805,0.05299999937415123,0.9430000185966492
the 13900k is looking pretty good,0.004000000189989805,0.05400000140070915,0.9419999718666077
cant wait to see what 13900k can do when tuned as well,0.003000000026077032,0.0560000017285347,0.9409999847412109
ladies and gentleman were back in a cpu war intel 13900k 58999 ryzen 9 7950x 69999 performance to price is extremely interesting this time aroundbenchmarks soon notis on,0.003000000026077032,0.057999998331069946,0.9390000104904175
my 4090 shipped today and my 13900k is shipping on launch day locked in the preorder wz2 should be fun,0.0020000000949949026,0.06700000166893005,0.9309999942779541
yeah i agreei think we are going to get damn close to 90fps with this 4090 13900k combo im itching to try it out i might make it one of my first real performance tests ,0.004999999888241291,0.06700000166893005,0.9279999732971191
13900k vs 12900k is 1 morefps in average in games xd great ,0.006000000052154064,0.07000000029802322,0.9240000247955322
13900k is going to be a beast and cheaper than amds newest offering will likely out preform it in single and multithreaded workloads plus if you already have an alder lake system you can just drop it in if you are talking strickly the newest gen its currently intelnvidia,0.007000000216066837,0.07999999821186066,0.9129999876022339
gonna head to micro center again at like 4am to try to pick up a 13900k d i really hope my faster 2x16 ddr4 kits work with it i think itll beat the 7950x in warzone,0.004999999888241291,0.08299999684095383,0.9110000133514404
lf2 360 13900k is gonna be a beast,0.010999999940395355,0.08500000089406967,0.9049999713897705
i have a feeling 13900k will be better than we think ,0.00800000037997961,0.09099999815225601,0.9010000228881836
13900k x 4090 im going to be unstoppable,0.008999999612569809,0.09399999678134918,0.8970000147819519
finally finished scripting the 13900k review i worked on creating a whole new review format for desktop cpus hopefully you prefer it soon i can focus on serpent canyon,0.004999999888241291,0.10300000011920929,0.8920000195503235
iam very much interested in the uplift from 13900k over the 12900k in gaming and if it can beat the 7700x by more than 5 or not lets see,0.004999999888241291,0.11999999731779099,0.875
personally the 13th gen cpu thats actually going to be interesting is the i3 13100f if it gains the same bump in performance against the 12100f that the 13900k got against the 12900k while keeping the same price then its going to be a 125 behemoth of a budget gaming cpu,0.007000000216066837,0.12200000137090683,0.8709999918937683
not 100 sure yet almost certainly an i913900k when they release 64gb of ram and a couple of m2 ssds as well as my existing bunch of 25 ssds just basically putting together the best machine i can possibly buy tbh,0.008999999612569809,0.1340000033378601,0.8579999804496765
ive already seen a 13900k at 59ghz all p pulling 314w in prime thats miles better than stock,0.014000000432133675,0.1420000046491623,0.843999981880188
yee in the end the 13900k is the better buy because of the lower cost the performance uplift over the 7950x should not be more than 510 so nothing you will feel in the end i think i still would buy the 7950x because the long platform support,0.023000000044703484,0.13300000131130219,0.8429999947547913
for pure gaming the 13900k has better clocks and will give you higher fps for any other workload the 7950x is better,0.014999999664723873,0.14499999582767487,0.8389999866485596
lol i now watched hub review different picture zen4 handily wins mt apps with slower ram on gaming modest win for the 13900k and no issue with zen4s 1lows ddr56000 helps for lower skus not tested zen4 should tiewin 7700x perfs slightly above the 7950x for games,0.009999999776482582,0.1589999943971634,0.8299999833106995
13900k is 569 at micro center 7950x is 699 13900k is currently a much better deal especially if you already have z690,0.008999999612569809,0.16699999570846558,0.8240000009536743
intel shows core i913900k raptor lake cpu to deliver 11 better gaming performance than amd ryzen 9 7950x,0.004000000189989805,0.1720000058412552,0.8240000009536743
7700x is very well positioned and trading blows with 13900k also power consuption wich is way more important in this times than nefore,0.012000000104308128,0.17000000178813934,0.8190000057220459
im more interested in 13900k at 88w cap vs 12900ks and 12900k unlimited power still managed to beat both of them nice one 13900k,0.01899999938905239,0.17000000178813934,0.8109999895095825
hopefully you could update with 13900k thanks,0.007000000216066837,0.18799999356269836,0.8050000071525574
100 agree im just waiting for the tuf gaming to come back in stock at 2959aud hey ive got an interesting video idea for ya tech run a 4090 with cyberpunk on a 3700x or equivalent and then compare that run with a 13900k,0.007000000216066837,0.19099999964237213,0.8019999861717224
well if u can get i9 13900k its best gpu 3070 is fine maybe buy used one for 400â‚¬,0.017000000923871994,0.1940000057220459,0.7889999747276306
core i913900k according to the tests of intel itself significantly performs better in games compared to ryzen 9 7950x slides from a recent intel presentation got into the network where it is clearly visible that in most games the intel flagship is faster than the amd,0.007000000216066837,0.210999995470047,0.7820000052452087
in games 13900k will have a huge uplift over 12000k 700mhz gain in ring clock is huge its basically like turning e cores off with 12900k so probably 1020 gain in games,0.009999999776482582,0.20800000429153442,0.7820000052452087
that way you see that even the little brother outperfoms the 12900k the 13900k might be a different story hopefully,0.009999999776482582,0.22200000286102295,0.7689999938011169
its also differentiating the 13600k as a good allrounder and the 13900k as a cpu with a lot of efficiency potential,0.010999999940395355,0.22699999809265137,0.7620000243186951
13900k will run hot im sure of it bro,0.01899999938905239,0.25,0.7300000190734863
yeah came just in time for some additional benchmarks on the i9 13900k see if we can make it sing a bit more,0.006000000052154064,0.2770000100135803,0.7170000076293945
i see 7950x vs 13900k oc and ram optimizing timings 7950x is a best waiting your stats,0.02500000037252903,0.26100000739097595,0.7149999737739563
13900k is better than amds best at both,0.02199999988079071,0.26600000262260437,0.7120000123977661
yee a tuned 7700x should beat the 13900k but you could also tune the 13900k to get again like 510 wins,0.008999999612569809,0.28299999237060547,0.7080000042915344
single core on the 13900k wins outright over amd insane speeds,0.01899999938905239,0.2919999957084656,0.6899999976158142
this is interesting how would they fudge these numbers for the 13900k it is the chart topper for gaming,0.009999999776482582,0.3059999942779541,0.6840000152587891
while were on the topic of esports benchmarking got a 7950x and 13900k picked up just now the man loaned me a 6950xt to test with so we should be seeing some numbers very very soon now its time to get the channel branding going ,0.003000000026077032,0.3140000104904175,0.6830000281333923
today is the day of the start of sales of intel raptor lake processors and at the same time the day of publication of reviews finally we can find out what the new products led by the core i913900k are capable of lets start with the general results as you can see they,0.004000000189989805,0.33000001311302185,0.6660000085830688
and itll run best on a 13900k ,0.00800000037997961,0.3269999921321869,0.6650000214576721

yes the 13900k will be faster than the 12900k but i really think the focus should be on the value the 13600k brings i will pay special attention to this in my review,0.03500000014901161,0.32100000977516174,0.6439999938011169
love to see a comparison of this intel setup against a 13900k z690 wddr4 for us people on a budget,0.013000000268220901,0.3449999988079071,0.6420000195503235
with the new intel 13900k will be better,0.03099999949336052,0.3400000035762787,0.6290000081062317
good goddess just watched some of the intel 13900k reviews just shy of 500 watts for a cpu load,0.050999999046325684,0.32100000977516174,0.628000020980835
if this is true its good news for zen4 it means there is no 10 perf over ald in games just 23 and that actually laughable for rpl im waiting for a more thorough review though when you get your 13900k in hands to see more ocing and more games tested,0.04800000041723251,0.3269999921321869,0.6240000128746033
intel 13900k reviews ok boss see you at 9 am,0.029999999329447746,0.34599998593330383,0.6240000128746033
man i building a brand new pc around my 4090 also lol im doing my best to wait for the i913900k but i may end up getting the i912900k,0.03400000184774399,0.34200000762939453,0.6240000128746033
we played death match and one erangle we held 220260 on max settings 1440p we did peak higher in some spots i believe the 13900k with the 4090 will be wild,0.007000000216066837,0.39800000190734863,0.5950000286102295
i think even 13900k can reach 500w if you push it hard enough with a chiller during a prime95 small ffts run lol,0.01600000075995922,0.39899998903274536,0.5849999785423279
zen4 has better memory latency than zen3 beside 5800x3d is running at 4450mhz so at 5200mhz with 3d will beat intel 13900k,0.02500000037252903,0.39399999380111694,0.5809999704360962

funny thing is the 7700x is usually faster than the 7950x in gaming so 13900k is likely on par with the much cheaper 7700x,0.028999999165534973,0.41499999165534973,0.5559999942779541

i can imagine 2 other cpus better than a maxed out 12900k max out 13900k zen4 3d,0.03400000184774399,0.48500001430511475,0.48100000619888306
i figured amd will cook up a x3d version of the 7000 shortly after the 13900k launchesitll be interesting to see what intel throws at us ,0.007000000216066837,0.5199999809265137,0.47200000286102295
the cache on the 13900k is supposed tuned and the imc is supposed to be better i wonder if the cache on the 13900k can be tuned even further,0.01899999938905239,0.5130000114440918,0.46799999475479126
like an idiot im actually looking at the upcoming #intel 13900k cpu mobos ddr5 ram normally i use the hedt platform as i need the most pcie lanesslots i can get but i like the performance boost with these new systems pcie 45 gfx cards cover so many slots now,0.1679999977350235,0.36500000953674316,0.46700000762939453
7950x 300w at stock with 36k r23 well thats something new coz what ive hearing is 230w at stock with 38200 39 with pbo yeah 13900k definitely got temperature advantage at stock due to better ihs and bigger die but ive seen temperature dropping about 10c cooler offset,0.01899999938905239,0.5170000195503235,0.46399998664855957
roundup just like i thought the 13900k is a bit faster than the 7700x or 7950x i think a tuned 7700x can beat the 13900k in gaming but you can tune the 13900k as well so in the end more or less a draw gaming wise with raptorlake winning by like 510,0.017000000923871994,0.527999997138977,0.45500001311302185

its on par in multithread and a few percent win in gaming 7950x vs 13900k that means every other skew 13700k vs 7700x 12600k vs 7600x will be slightly faster in multithread and a solid lose in gaming they are basically on par you can claim winlose based on your preference,0.026000000536441803,0.531000018119812,0.4429999887943268

if youre set on 4k gaming a 13600k or a 7600x paired with a 4090 will give you every bit of performance a 2x more expensive 7950x or 13900k will,0.07800000160932541,0.5189999938011169,0.40400001406669617

the 150â‚¬ difference between the i9 13900k and the ryzen 9 7950x is kinda tempting me to go team blue on one end intel uses a lot more power on the other hand amd heats up so much the perfs are really fucking close it seems and its mostly to play games though ,0.25600001215934753,0.42500001192092896,0.3190000057220459

so after watching a few well listening to a few lets be real the 13900k7950x is closer than i thought amd absolutely kills it with heat and efficiency but intel does take single and sometime multi threaded crown intel weirdly gets the platform crown this time too,0.18799999356269836,0.4950000047683716,0.31700000166893005

 based on your i9 13900k review and on the overall consensus for the 7700x and 7600x would you say amd should have increased the core number per tier this generation ie making the 7600x an 8c16t cpu at the very least,0.03799999877810478,0.8889999985694885,0.0729999989271164

even if we dont think its selling well because thats our perception doesnt mean its something that should be avoided my 7950x is extremly fast at 55ghz all core and 575 single core it trades blows with any non ln2 13900k and uses much less power,0.5400000214576721,0.40299999713897705,0.057999998331069946

im gonna come out and say it if you buy both a 13900k and a 4090 youre probably too concerned about your epeen if youre gaming at 4k where the 4090 can stretch its legs the 13900k is wasted at 1080p the 4090 is wasted and at 1440p itll go back and forth,0.5429999828338623,0.42100000381469727,0.035999998450279236

heres some early takeaways from the intel i913900k reviews 1 its not much faster overall than the ryzen 7950x the two cpus trade blows across workloads 2 the 13900k thermal throttles itself fast and thats even using a 360mm aio water cooler too hot slows down,0.628000020980835,0.35199999809265137,0.020999999716877937

yeah the 7950x landed with us the day before the embargo so no chance to include it sadly i dont anticipate 7950x will be significantly faster than 7900x in the scenario you outlined 13900k should still be the overall winner but we are planning to test it and 7700x so tbc,0.7639999985694885,0.2150000035762787,0.020999999716877937

but i also have to say that the 13900k is not nearly as efficient as i thought i thought it hits 38k points cb r23 with like 250w but it needs 300w for that score the 7950x does the same score with only 230w power consumption thats 30 more wattage for same performance,0.7570000290870667,0.2240000069141388,0.017999999225139618

that doesnt make sense the 13900k didnt beat the 7950 or the 7700 by alot in some cases they trade blows game to game so this would mean that the 13600k would either tie or beat the 13900k which automatically makes the 13900k redundant in gaming vs the 13600k,0.6349999904632568,0.3499999940395355,0.01600000075995922
1 runs benchmarks through teamviewer which basically encodes the stream on the cpu and you obviously lose performance doing that 2 compared it to a delidded fully tuned 12900k with adie vs a 13900k with mdie that nobody knows what kind of oc he did,0.625,0.36000001430511475,0.01600000075995922

so from what i can gather from the headlines and the thumbnails the 13900k beats the 7950x in single and multithreaded things the 13900k uses a disgusting amount of power the 13900k produces a disgusting amount of heat the 7950x priceperf is in question,0.7590000033378601,0.22599999606609344,0.014999999664723873
any cost savings people thought could be had by using cheap and plentiful ddr4 ram with an 13900k has gone up in smokes if you use ddr4 you lose a ton of performance almost an entire product tiers worth so youll need to replace your ram anyway,0.8169999718666077,0.1679999977350235,0.014999999664723873
there is a difference between a cpu running at 95c by design and another running at 95c because it consumes shit ton of power still dont understand how fanboys try so hard to make themselves stick out like a sore thumb this isnt rocket science the 13900k is hot and hungry,0.7900000214576721,0.19499999284744263,0.014999999664723873

it is just a 6core cpu with 12 threads even this cpu called 7600x3d will destroy raptor 13900k with the more of cache in gaming unfortunately the price for the mainboards and cpus are too high in europe you have to pay 700â‚¬ for a x670egene 350â‚¬ for the cpu and 200â‚¬,0.8450000286102295,0.14100000262260437,0.014000000432133675

yes by 10 if rpl would havewill have another 10 on top of adl 20 total that would be very bad for zen4 dont you think also this means zen4 3d will wipe the floor with adlrpl if 13900k tuned 12900k rpl was supposed to being another 10,0.7490000128746033,0.23800000548362732,0.012000000104308128
the power draw is fcking ridiculous im glad intel is competing we need them to compete but can you imagine running a 13900k under full load during our sa summers i doubt a decent 360 clc could cool it so i suspect itll throttle constantly,0.9020000100135803,0.08799999952316284,0.010999999940395355

so some of the takeaways the 13900k runs too hot for its own good and its too difficult to cool even though ryzen 7000 runs damn hot as well it doesnt lose performance to the heat the 13900k does,0.8479999899864197,0.14100000262260437,0.009999999776482582
ehh kinda but keep in mind that 13900k doesnt scale past 300w in general 13900k is not a golden product it def has its disadvantages but it makes 7950x redundant imo if you render with your cpu not gpu both these cpus are not ideal,0.8629999756813049,0.12800000607967377,0.009999999776482582

im noticing a ton of 13900k reviews with lower performance in premiere pro than they should be getting im guessing they dont understand quick sync and arent enabling it really holds intel back and misrepresents the true performance difference between intel and amd imo,0.8830000162124634,0.10899999737739563,0.00800000037997961
why is this nothing like hubs numbers in their tests 13900k gets destroyed by r9 7950x at every power level,0.8939999938011169,0.09799999743700027,0.00800000037997961
also right side does not have temps my guess because of nda so must bei 13900k tbh i think you already violated nda by showing performance numbers,0.7889999747276306,0.2029999941587448,0.00800000037997961
there appears to be an error in your conclusions near the end the price you are quoting for the 13900k i think is the intel wholesale price i hate that intel do it that way to try and make their chips appear cheaper as on newegg currently its 660 so the diff is much less,0.8809999823570251,0.11299999803304672,0.007000000216066837
this is just pure wrong sure it shows the efficiency of the 13900k against itself but comparing it against dog slow ddr5 4800 on 12900k is really handicapping 12th gen in these charts,0.8769999742507935,0.11699999868869781,0.007000000216066837
feels a bit sad to say it but the 79xx and 13900k products are really disinteresting so much power consumption and heat for what,0.9110000133514404,0.0820000022649765,0.007000000216066837
yeah i think a lot of people are complete clowns and they dont even realise you practically need a 7950x13900k to even utilise a 4090 and even still you will be bottlenecked,0.906000018119812,0.08699999749660492,0.007000000216066837
if i see one more fucking comment about my 9900k being a bottleneck to the 4090 im going to cry i fucking get it im waiting for the 13900k eat a bag of dicks this is not addressed at you guys on twitter that is just what i feel like screaming at every comment,0.9509999752044678,0.0430000014603138,0.006000000052154064
i should also mention that that 13900k result was done with a horrible tune my 12900ks in my daily rig beats that 13900k result and its not even close look at his channel its full of shit,0.9509999752044678,0.0430000014603138,0.006000000052154064
lino have you not seen how horrible the 13900k benchmarks are bro this thing is unbelievably inefficient for like 9 performance gain in games,0.9480000138282776,0.04600000008940697,0.006000000052154064
