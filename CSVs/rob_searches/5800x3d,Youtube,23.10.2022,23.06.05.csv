super cool thanks certainly my fav tech channel the way you present stuff is just golden so cleannn would have been neat to see the 5900x in the lineup given that it would be an interesting comparison within amd and given that comparison on intel has a more premium product with the 12900ks if the results were not interesting at least a quick comment where it should land between the items in the lineup would be nice,0.004000000189989805,0.024000000208616257,0.9729999899864197

this makes me very excited for am5 since those will be using this stacked cache too with a major difference with a new socket instead of a retrofit they have a lot more room for error which is a big part of why it took this long to launch,0.004000000189989805,0.02800000086426735,0.9679999947547913
would be great to see this on future ryzen chips hopefully with higher clockspeeds and better allround performance instead of just gaming performance next few years are going to be great in terms of cpu competition personally i need an upgrade in about 2 years going ryzen 8000 series or meteor lake aka 14th gen depending on perfdollar while ryzen 5800x3d is great i guess it is mostly for people with older ryzens which have motherboards that support this i still think 12600k and 12700k offers better value and allround performance,0.004000000189989805,0.02800000086426735,0.9679999947547913
i ordered mine at launch and got it 2 weeks later and its been running on my 1080p itx skyreach mini s4 setup with alienware 360hz monitor and the fps is amazing the temps vg the fan noise much lower than my older r5 3600 nonx under gaming loads etc the power draw on5800x3d was lower under load than the r5 3600 its definitely a powerhouse chip that down the road in a few years will still command a hefty premium and perform well for a long time,0.004000000189989805,0.02800000086426735,0.9679999947547913

"this makes me very excited for zen 4 regardless if they use this 3d technology or not it will probably be faster in games than this 5800x3d while being faster in nongaming work and more efficient thanks to the 5nm node process and other improvements

and with intel competing again and apple with the m2 family i dont think zen 4 will live as long as zen 3 and we will see zen 5 with core count increased and more improvements not long after zen 4 when ddr5 memory will hopefully be cheaper and chip shortage slowed down",0.004999999888241291,0.032999999821186066,0.9629999995231628

wow the jump over 5800x in some of those games was huge it will be interesting to see how this carries over to 7800x3d if amd will also add a 7600x3d

kudos to amd intel have been extremely vocal upto amds 5000 about how they are the best because everyone games at 720p apparently so the second intel actually produce a better all round cpu amd gets the glue out and beats it at gaming awesome stuff by amd just another reason they are the true enthusiasts champion even if intel have finally pulled there finger out there arse,0.00800000037997961,0.041999999433755875,0.949999988079071

from the 3 tech channels i follow hub gn ltt this review was the most well rounded the comparison between the 5800x 12900k and 12900ks is obvious but the extra ram settings from reasonable to balls to the walls with the completed platform price summary are such a good angles to include in order to show the whole picture good job as usual,0.004999999888241291,0.04699999839067459,0.9480000138282776

this is such an interesting cpu and gives a chance to show where cache really matters this really makes me wonder what an x3d 5900x and 5950x would have looked like it would have been interesting to see how it worked across chiplets i also cant wait to see what an architecture thats built from the ground up for 3d cache can do rather than it just being tacked on to an already funcional cpu at the end as 3d stacking gets more complex and moves to logic i bet we see some interesting thermal solutions too the future is exciting well at least in tech it is,0.004000000189989805,0.04800000041723251,0.9480000138282776

what makes this so impressive is that this is a year old cpu that has been made to match and at times beat a brand new architecture just by adding innovative packaging its the same node same architecture with no clock speed improvements a regression actually and it can go toe to toe with the special edition of intels best new chip whats going to happen when they put vcache on zen 4,0.00800000037997961,0.04899999871850014,0.9430000185966492
i really appreciated your approach on this one it really hammers home the concept of not overpaying for cpu if your main focus is gaming also the x370 vs x570 comparison was a great addition and not something ive seen on other reviews good job,0.012000000104308128,0.04500000178813934,0.9430000185966492
you and gamer nexus steve did an amazing job on these reviews they both help me see how its about the same in production and im mainly gaming focused for now im glad to see a fair comparison on both ends and wtf kind of response is that intel 800 cant wait to see the 30 game follow up,0.009999999776482582,0.04800000041723251,0.9419999718666077

so if a company gives you a chance to upgrade from 1800x to a cpu that gives same performance with the last last gen new cpu like 12900ks with very little cost we have to be very thankfull having such a nice gift there is no words to say to 5800x3d except to thanks it hardly,0.009999999776482582,0.050999999046325684,0.9399999976158142

on am4 looks really really good as a upgrade path im on 3000 quad core series the gains are still massive and and you get to keep all your hardware sell your current cpu to get a discount nice people buying new intel looks great but there is a huge price tag difference intel is more expensive ddr5 is expensive the motherboards they are a bit more expensive your cpu cooling it has to be a bit more expensive ,0.010999999940395355,0.050999999046325684,0.9390000104904175
i got absolute bargains on a 5900x and 5950x from people upgrading their systems to the 5800x3d on the used market its a great tech demo and a very interesting preview for future platforms however i think many people threw away better chips for unrealistic gains in gaming performance,0.009999999776482582,0.050999999046325684,0.9380000233650208

the best thing is this was just a test run basically and on a fairly old platform seeing how well it can do means same technology can be applied to future platforms and architectures including gpus since they also use l2 cache which is fairly important but is rarely ever talked about imagine if the same design were to applied to a flagship like a 5950x or give a midrange option like 5600x the possibilities are endless for the future instead of just piling on more cores and powerheat as not all games or applications need it interested to see how it bodes for the future,0.004999999888241291,0.061000000685453415,0.9340000152587891

impressive product in my opinion the performance increase with a wattage decrease shows actual technological improvements as opposed to dual turbo charging and then super charging your cpu and blasting 300 watts through it much much better for sff builds going to be way easier to cool,0.013000000268220901,0.05299999937415123,0.9330000281333923

so glad i went amd when i built my pc back in late 2019 with an x570 board and a 3700x when zen 4 releases and the price on the 5800x3d drops i think ill upgrade to it and be able to extend the life of my system for at least another 3 years,0.004999999888241291,0.06599999964237213,0.9279999732971191

this seems excellent for gaming if you have a compatible am4 board and want to max it out via upgrading instead of replacing your entire system im on a 3700x and 2080 super and will do just that and keep using this system for likely at least 4 years maybe more since ill probably want to upgrade the gpu at some point,0.004000000189989805,0.0689999982714653,0.9269999861717224
thank you another very thoroughly thought out and well done review this sounds like the reason to choose between the intel and amd cpus back in 2000 amd better for gaming intel better for business with the exception that it seems that even in business workloads that amd has the value point by a wide margin it will be interesting to see how intel responds to this massive cache scheme or if they respond at all,0.00800000037997961,0.06499999761581421,0.9269999861717224

probably the best cpu deal in history for gaming specifically no need for expensive ddr5 ram or a new mobo and compatible all the way back to platforms running ryzen firstgen cpus with some asterisks here all things considered its a more than reasonable price with no extra costs for those already on the am4 platform and buying it will further the mileage out of your old ddr4 ram and am4 motherboard all while giving you performance that is practically sitting at the current peak of gaming performance seriously doubted this would even touch the 12900k or ks and im glad im wrong and infact it has shown the importance of cache for gaming workloads,0.009999999776482582,0.0689999982714653,0.9210000038146973
great review i know 1080p is more of a true cpu test but it would be interesting to see how 5800x3d performs at 1440p which i think most people who buy this cpu would be playing at ,0.006000000052154064,0.0729999989271164,0.9210000038146973

this seems a great cpu for competitive gamers with a dedicated setup 1080p 360hz low detail 3080 or better but not for most of the gamers and thats ok if you are using 2k4k high detail you already know that to boost fps you dont need a new cpu but a new gpu,0.007000000216066837,0.07199999690055847,0.9210000038146973
wow what a gain the cpu itself is a little slower than the 5800x due to lower clock but holy st what a gain only adding some cache i think that in the future cpu will have a lot more cache,0.013000000268220901,0.06800000369548798,0.9190000295639038

really the 5800x3d is amazing on games that benefits from cachememory scaling and for a drop in replacement makes the value cost a thing i was going to upgrade 2 desktops using second gen ryzen to a 5800x5900x but im getting one of these for me and giving my 5800x back the games i play really benefits and should not cost me any money,0.014999999664723873,0.07000000029802322,0.9150000214576721

i already have an am4 platformmsi b550 gaming edge wifi ryzen 7 5800x3d gave me a good option to upgrade in the future and it guaranteed another few years of life extension for an aging am4 socket its gaming performance is comparable to latest intel offering imho its gaming performance will probably increase with the new bios version game patches and os patches so that it can efficiently utilize that huge cache,0.004999999888241291,0.08100000023841858,0.9139999747276306
i think there should be more excitement amd having a successful outing showing that this manufacturing process is possible and shows uplifts in gaming can bring more options in later chips yes it restricts overclocking and upgradeability but some folks dont upgrade that often or overclock their hardware,0.006000000052154064,0.07999999821186066,0.9139999747276306
pretty impressed with the 5800x3d thus far and it is about what i expected and certainly worth the money for someone perhaps still on a 2700x or 3600x etcnot sure id even bother if i was already on any of the 5600x and up series of cpus as its not as if they are just barely adequate as is,0.012000000104308128,0.07599999755620956,0.9129999876022339

all said its true when you testing well optimized games but check out microsoft flight simulator or star citizen and you will see the benefits today i just like the amd strategy when you are able to put a new cpu in 5 year old motherboard and in this case you dont even need to upgrade your ddr4 3200 memory,0.007000000216066837,0.08500000089406967,0.9089999794960022
i thank you for your testing taken together with other reviews i see that this chip is really meant for a very niche upgrade you gotta get this and a next gen graphics card that will be more powerful than a current 4090 or 6900xt if you want to play higher than 1080p high settings you could get away with just slotting in this chip if you only do 1080p medhigh settings its apparent that everything is gpu bound at 1440p up but i think a lot of ppl want to upgrade to am5 and will skip this,0.009999999776482582,0.0820000022649765,0.9079999923706055
thanks for including the 2700x in some of the charts wow how time flies its been almost 6 years since i built my 2700x with asus rog xhair vii gen2 x470 mb rig in all its rgb glory im looking to upgrade the cpu since am4 is retiring i want to get the chip now before supplies get low my choices are 5950x 5900x 5800x3d or 5800x or something else if anyone has suggestions does anyone know how any of those 5000 series would run on my x470 motherboard i assume your test mb is x5xx does performance differ between my 470 to a x5xx,0.004999999888241291,0.08699999749660492,0.9070000052452087
excellent video i hope ddr5 gets cheaper in time to zen 4 and whatever intel gets next my only suggestion regarding those tests is if the game get to a gpu bottleneck test with reduced settings high or medium just for the sake of finding out which cpu is faster,0.010999999940395355,0.08299999684095383,0.906000018119812
i think both cpus are good one hits the gaming market but doesnt completely take the cake and intel hits a more complete package being both a functional workstation and a good gamer if youre only a gamer and youre upgrading from an old build x3d is great choice,0.013000000268220901,0.08100000023841858,0.906000018119812

can i just say this is just the beginning for this type of technology the 3d caching theyre using that is if i remember what amd was stating in the past with this the tech will be used on all future desktop cpus which is going to be pretty amazing after seeing this intel is going to need to up their game on something now ,0.006000000052154064,0.0949999988079071,0.8989999890327454

one game id like to see this benchmarked on is flight sim ltt has it in their video and it shows that the cache is really beneficial in that title this makes sense considering how many small objects ground traffic airport vehicles boats animals ect moving on paths there are in the game as a flight sim enthusiast id sure appriciate seeing how this product stacks up,0.007000000216066837,0.09600000083446503,0.8970000147819519

wowww amd really delivered on this one wasnt expecting an actual significant uplift over my 5800x and it would less impactful at 1440p but now it gives me one potential last upgrade on the am4 platform before moving on cache really is king for gaming,0.01899999938905239,0.08699999749660492,0.8949999809265137

but for 100 more you get double the cores with small average performance drop off but much better 1 lows in the 5950x or the intel offerings great proof of concept and while it is technically the best gaming cpu more cores equals less problems i upgraded from a ryzen 1700 to a 5800x then to a 5950x because my friend couldnt find a cpu and i could sell my 5800x to them and get an upgrade in one fell swoop the difference is just great and you will thank yourself if you can afford it,0.014000000432133675,0.09099999815225601,0.8949999809265137

this is a big win for amd in the efficiency department now wouldnt it be interesting if intel put 3d stacked cache on a 12900ks why brute force fps with more wattage and a higher power bill when you can finesse the same fps or more with a elegant implementation of cache,0.008999999612569809,0.09799999743700027,0.8930000066757202

with all the recent chip releases from amd and support for ryzen 5000 on 300 series motherboards it seems like these chips are great update paths for users who built systems in 2017 at the same time its also a way for amd to sell chips that didnt make the cut to be the higher equivalent the 5800x vs 5700x is a great example the 5700x is litteraly the same chip just clocked slightly lower,0.007000000216066837,0.13099999725818634,0.8619999885559082

it would be a lot more helpful if 6core cpus like the 5600 12400f and 3600 were included in these benchmarks because the 5600 and 12400f are the best value cpus right now and seeing just how close they are to even the fastest gaming cpus is very important information for consumers for the same reasons that the 5800x is a better value than the 5800x3d the 5600 is a much better value than the 5800x and a much better value than the 5700x as well for a gaming pc,0.009999999776482582,0.14100000262260437,0.8489999771118164
now to figure out what i swap my 2700 out for one of these or bank on a higher core cpu being better going forward great to see both amd and intel pushing each other again though if amd can figure out a way around the thermal and voltage limitations though to keep clock speeds higher and temps lower they have a fantastic technology to mature and work upon and that can only get better i suspect the 5800x3d given the am4 retiring is more for proof of concept,0.010999999940395355,0.14000000059604645,0.8479999899864197

very compelling for day to day use i doubt id notice much when it comes to the slower clocks but temps would also probably be better on average in terms of achieving a nice bump to fps even at 1440p feels like this would be a decent and relatively cost effective upgrade for gaming rigs looking to utilize the last legs of the am4 platform,0.014000000432133675,0.14399999380111694,0.8420000076293945

i mean yeah the 5700x or even the 5600 sounds like a more reasonable upgrade o me since its a much cheaper upgrade while still giving you a great performance uplift or instead go for the 5900x or 5950x if you can spend infinite money and want the best multi core performance however the 5800x3d is not a bad upgrade at all its still one of the best cpus out there for the am4 platform and he best one for cachesensitive applications like gaming,0.017000000923871994,0.15600000321865082,0.8270000219345093

the way i see it the 5800x3d is great for those already sporting amd 4 and a 2year cpu it will allow you to add probably 2 to 4 years of life to most of your system that said right now and probably for the next 3 or so months if you are in a situation where you need to rebuild to the point of needing a new cpu motherboard combo and maybe ram or need a completely new system you have to go intel 12th with the i5 12600 k that is an absolute winner for its price or if can go the extra mile get the any of the i7 12700 available and take advantage of already having pcie gen 5 that will be the true limiting factor in terms of upgrade ability in the next pair of years the reality is that for most cases any of the most current cpu being it the 5800x3d 5800 5900 or i5 12600k or i7 12700 have enough life on them for realistically last 5 years where cpu performance is not be a concern and where most likely the major changes will be in terms of gpu storage or eventually ram if i look at things the way they actually are for most of us in the last 6 years the new parts in my case were a new cpu 980 to 2070 super 16 gb ddr 3 ram 16 to 32 and 2 new ssd 500gb and 1 tera cpu and motherboard happily lasted 6 years without any change and i had no problems running any of the games i wanted until read dead redemption 2 suggested a gpu change that said when external factors long term remote work demanded a new system this month i had to go intel 12th motherboard to ensure pcie gen 5 with an eye on a next gen gpu in the next 24 months,0.013000000268220901,0.19099999964237213,0.7960000038146973

nice review how about a amd vs intelnvidia video where you build a maxtout amd system with 5800x3d and a 6900xt and compare it to a 12900ks with a 3090ti and then look at the best performance in avg fps 1 low but also compare stock vs oc and especially look at power use i think the nvidiaintel combi will be the faster but just with a little bit of difference but amd will be way more efficient and almost as fast and maybe in 1 low even better,0.008999999612569809,0.23199999332427979,0.7580000162124634
that is also why broadwell has ages surprisingly well the big 128 mib l4 cache can do a lot in some games io that one test on intel 10th gen where cache could do more than cores in some or even back on lga775 where the same clocks with bigger cache could improve performance,0.008999999612569809,0.23399999737739563,0.7570000290870667
i think it would be interesting to come up with some one off unique tests for this cpu to see where that cache can get things moving it would be cool to see even just 3 cpus 5800x 580x3d and 12900k for a better value preposition for science maybe some vr benchmarks,0.008999999612569809,0.23399999737739563,0.7570000290870667
even at 1440p there still a decent gain im thinking of doing a build with the 5800x3d i have everything i need for the build laying around so i might pick one up i was thinking of doing a 12700k build but might just do a 5800x3d because i have a x470 crosshair vii mb i have a 2700x with now just as a tinker build also still have a 5950x 3900x and 9900ks builds as you can see i just like building systems and never sell anything if i get a 5800x3d i might put it in my main system i have a 5950x 3080ti in now i use it mainly for gaming at 1440p and ill put my 5950x with a 2080ti 9900ks with a nitro 5700xt 3900x with a radeon vii but i think the price will drop on the 5800x3d fast its crazy how cheap the 5900x and 5950x have gotten in the last week it would be hard to choose the 5800x3d or the 5900x it just depends what you do with the build,0.006000000052154064,0.23999999463558197,0.7549999952316284

nice approach to the review very good for people who want more of a real world experience benefit i went through some of the same mental gymnastics i have an original gigabyte b350 gaming 3 and had that paired with a ryzen 1700x and 32gb of ram which btw wasnt able to hit ddr 3200 as advertised on older bios revisions i eventually upgraded to the 3700x and then when i discovered 5000 series would be supported i went back and forth and finally went with the 5900x after the amd price drops gaming performance has not been substantially better yet but going from a 3700x what made sense for me was going to the processor with 12c24t instead of another cpu with the same core count plus the 5900x has the higher clock speeds im still using a rtx 2080 also so i think with this 45 year motherboard and 12 core cpu the next gen graphics cards will be a really good pairing and give the market time to stabilize a bit more around ddr5 and pcie 5 with the 5900x costing384 wowon amazon and newegg today id consider that a much better path for others considering a 3000 series upgrade and a good way to close out our am4 systems,0.02800000086426735,0.2409999966621399,0.7310000061988831

amd has definitely found a winning formula for a top gaming cpu with that being said next gen 3d vcache cpus are gonna be absolute monsters if a mid range zen3 based cpu clocked to just 45ghz and added extra 64mb of cache can do this much damage in games imagine what a zen4 based cpu with the same technology can do if i had to make an educated guess the 7800x3d is gonna be clocked to at least 5ghz or maybe even more considering the jump from 7nm to 5nm and the non3d vcache models will be boosting to at least 55ghz as shown by amd in their zen4 tech demo also you have to consider the matured 3d vcache technology by then with the same 96mb of l3 then you add the ipc increase etc now pause for a second and think about the fact that amd will also have dual ccx 3d vcache cpus coming as well and those will be 1216core 192mb 96mb of l3 per ccx monsters and whats best of all with the 3d vcache technology you dont need to invest in expensive memory especially ddr5 since there is very little benefit thanks to all that cache so something like a basic ddr55200 or ddr55600 memory will be more than enough and those kits have already started to come down to reasonable prices,0.039000000804662704,0.29899999499320984,0.6620000004768372

these gta 5 results actually make sense when you consider the amount of ai prediction it takes to run the game pedestrians and cars path perdiction trafic lights also there are alot of rng dependent spawns random events this is where the cache on the 5800x3d should thrive,0.02800000086426735,0.492000013589859,0.47999998927116394
from my personal studies of software optimization ive learned that larger caches are excellent for poorly optimized code or code where you have a lot of small objects and you dont bother keeping them in contiguous memory chunks this is very much the case for many games and certain data formats like json if you dont carefully design the code to collect all the little memory fragments into larger chunks it is also very useful in cases where you have large datasets and need to jump around randomly to do calculations since there is a greater chance that the data you need will still be in cache if it has more available cachelines ,0.06199999898672104,0.4620000123977661,0.47600001096725464

i think more dense and higher capacity cache is definitely the future memory accesses are really slow and a larger cache can help with that once a larger cache becomes more common the game developers might actually start optimizing for it which could give an even larger performance boost,0.07400000095367432,0.45399999618530273,0.47200000286102295
this was a really great video as many other articlesvideos mention is the power consumption as you noted here intel is absolutely ridiculous with its powerdraw amd using so much less juice yet out preforming the i9 what does that tell you here this is the reason i switched to amd over intel is because of this very reason in my latest build i am only aircooling vs the only option for intel which is watercooling and the added expense with the already pricey intel offerings themselves this is a nobrainer for a cost standpoint now the 5800x3d does have the lower clockspeeds and will hamper other operations such as video coding compiling but this cpu is listed as a gaming cpu so there are tradeoffs and is not for everyone for cost vs performance amd offerings make way better sense and will not have the added hit on your monthly power bill either the other added bonus is you can drop the 5800x3d into many existing amd4 motherboards giving new life to an older build where as with intel you need a new motherboard watercooler and much more cash to do it the price difference for intel vs amd is ridiculous,0.1979999989271164,0.3319999873638153,0.4699999988079071

the 101 lows are really interesting my theory is games that need the cache but dont load inout too often benefit from a larger cache those that dont use the cache dont benefit and those that load inout a lot get a hitworse result as a larger cache has a little more latency so depending on the game it can be betterworseno difference however as the cache is bigger it may be easier for compilers and programmers to aim for that size cache as while it has a latency hit to loading inout you have a lot more to work with and plan whenhow to load it in and what will benefit the enginesgames,0.05299999937415123,0.4950000047683716,0.4519999921321869
pay 500 more get a couple of more performance in a few things end up with requiring windows 11 and likely still having random issues with ecores sounds like a great deal intel though really intel clearly wanted this cpu to be compared against the 12900ks so people should do that for the pricing,0.0989999994635582,0.44999998807907104,0.45100000500679016

well at least is better from a price perspective compared to the 12900ks also that can be an upgrade path for a guy that upgrades more rarely lets say now he is cpu bottlenecked from a first or second gen ryzen this year he only upgrades his cpu you would say he will be cpu bottlenecked he probably has a lowmid end gpu and thats exactly the point of it yes he is for now he doesnt have that huge pocket but wants a good upgrade so in 1 or 2 yrs when he will afford or it will make sense for him to upgrade he will do that and guess what those gpus are gonna perform at the level of a 3080 if not even better so the cpu upgrade is pretty nice most of the ppl i know they upgrade like this not like buying a cpu gpu at the same time like bruh if you buy those 2 you are better of just build the entire pc since thats pretty much 6575 of the total money put into a pc if not even more,0.0560000017285347,0.49399998784065247,0.44999998807907104

the real benefit of the 5800x3d first you can use a cheap motherboard because you cant overclock it and also a cheap ram kit because of the big cache its not realiant on ram as much as all the others all of the other cpus need samsung bdie ram kits to match its performance which costs about twice as much as cheap hynix all in all a system with a 5800x is much more expensive if you want to match the x3d in gaming,0.14100000262260437,0.503000020980835,0.35600000619888306

i guess it will come down to a choice between the 5800x 3d and the 5900x slightly better performance in some games vs a lot more performance for productivity and perhaps better long term performance if games start using more cores i am looking to swap my old 2700x so no intel for me,0.04899999871850014,0.6039999723434448,0.34700000286102295

i think when you are comparing cpu performance you should always eliminate gpu bottleneck entirely even if it means lowering to medium because what matters is which cpu provides more performance that will also indicate which cpu will have greater longevity as games become more and more demanding on cpu yes it is not realistic of how people use these cpus but that is not the point point is to conclusively show which cpu has better performance and thus longer longevity on this point however i would like to see cpu benchmarks in games with raytracing with raytracing enabled but in low resolution like 720 because rt increases cpu demands extremely heavily and also gpu demands that is why low res should be used for example if i enable rt in cyberpunk i cannot get stable 60 and i am purely cpu limited on my 2700x gpu is bored while cpu is half dead from the load,0.14300000667572021,0.6729999780654907,0.18400000035762787

yeah modern games are much smarter about using the cache as much as possible usually at the engine level often relying on batch rendering calls and soa structs of arrays to keep data all close to each other and doing function calls on all data at one time during the end or beginning of a frame thus maximizing the likelihood of it entering cache and being reused in cache the entire time that data needs to be referenced older games were still primarily objectoriented rather than dataoriented so games like csgo will likely see very little benefit from double or even triple cache as they dont bother with cache optimization nearly as much modern games on the other hand will likely continue to see massive benefits from higher cache unfortunately we cant just trade out raw performance for cache though as there are too many applications that need the performance still and many people wouldnt be happy to see 10 improvements in some games while getting 20 reductions in performance in others that arent cache heavy on another note though this cpu will show people which games and applications cared about cache and which didnt though as youll see a significant difference in those two different types of application with this cpu,0.14499999582767487,0.6840000152587891,0.17100000381469727

i think what may end up happening is new bios updates will release giving more control over cpu voltages and possibly an option to manage the 3dvcache when trying to overclock thats my theory here because while the increased cache definitely helps the lower sustained clocks hold it back and since amd made it clear that the stacked die is very voltage sensitive so pushing the chip currently isnt an option without risk of damage so there needs to be a way around this to push the clocks otherwise the 12900ks will stay ahead by clocks alone,0.06499999761581421,0.8169999718666077,0.11800000071525574

of the several reviews ive seen they seem to come to very different conclusions one the one hand youre unlikely to see huge boosts in avg fr if youre playing at ultra hd or qhd on anything less than a 3090 ti6900xt however the whole idea of this cpu i think is that you could upgrade your am4 system and not need a cpufull system upgrade for several more years to me this cpu is about the next 34 years rather than what you can get out of it right now hardware unboxed came the closest to understanding this in their review,0.19900000095367432,0.7080000042915344,0.09300000220537186
steve you actually missed a trick using ddr4 3200 here in hardware unboxeds benchmarks he used two setups with the 5800x3d one using ddr4 3200 and one using ddr4 3800 and the 3800 gave another couple of boost to frames across the board for the 5800x3d so there was performance being left on the table in these benches for example in far cry 6 he got the same 173fps bench you did using the 5800x3d with the 3200 ram but got 180fps using the 3800mhz ram thats nearly a 5 gain,0.22699999809265137,0.6800000071525574,0.09300000220537186

have to disagree with the testing methodology here most people know you dont need a high end cpu for pushing high resolutions or midrange graphics cards were literally onetotwo quarters away from one the biggest leaps in gpu performance history surely existing am4 platform owners may be eyeing the 5800x3d to fuel one of the nextgen gpus to save on the costs of an entirely new platform the best way to simulate this is by reducing gpu load by lowering the resolution or detail settings all you need to do is look at gaming cpu benchmarks before and after ampere and rdna 2 released many cpus could easily feed the prior generation but the differences were laid bare afterwards for example it didnt make any sense to upgrade from zen 2 to zen 3 on turing or older however after ampere it was clear zen 2 bottlenecked anything faster than the rtx 3070,0.35600000619888306,0.5640000104904175,0.07999999821186066

its pretty funny how my 5900x went from fastest at gaming tied to 5950x to one of the slowest on the graph despite the actual architecture of the 5800x3d being the same and it being a lower tier cpu and of course intel pulling a surprise move here doesnt really matter though since i play on 4k and that resolution is always gpu bottlenecked cpu was 50 at the max during gaming and that was horizon zero dawn running at max settings on a rtx 3080 i think your fps needs to be at least 144 for 4k to even start being cpu bottlenecked and that rarely happens csgo and minecraft without shaders were the only 2 games that i have played that are cpu bottlenecked but i dont really count those because their graphics are very minimalistic,0.4790000021457672,0.4429999887943268,0.07800000160932541

i do disagree with your testing you arent really testing the cpu at this points its more of a gpu test now that is the reason most reviewers go for 1080p low setting it is to maximize the load on the cpu the more load you offload to the gpu makes the cpus behave similar that is why is usually does not matter what cpu you have when playing at 4k they will perform almost the same due to the gpu bottleneck the same bottleneck you introduced in these tests,0.6660000085830688,0.31700000166893005,0.017999999225139618

i think there is something wrong in the csgo tests done all the cpus are getting higher fps in this benchmark map i am getting in 1080p lowmed settings with r5 5600x and rx5700xt about 680 avg fps and there is people who could get 800 fps in this map i think that there is something wrong like multicore rendering off or something like that,0.7419999837875366,0.24199999868869781,0.01600000075995922
so basically if your gaming at 4k im running a 5900x the 5800x3d would show no performance gains 1440p is questionable but as for upgrading probably not worth it for me right now what do you guys think,0.7450000047683716,0.23899999260902405,0.01600000075995922
 jacobs amd has been tinkering with this since zen 2 the ryzen 3000 chips has the connecting pads for vcache but they never got the yields at the assembly stage acceptable i doubt intel can just go ahead and do it considering that amd had the prototype working prezen 2 release but isnt shipping in volume until now,0.5889999866485596,0.3959999978542328,0.014999999664723873

your methodology for testing cpus as described in the video is flawed though youre not testing the cpu youre testing the gpu also there was no mention that youre comparing a 600 cpu using plus 500 ram on what is most likely a plus 500 motherboard to a 450 cpu with sub 150 ram that works with 3 generations of motherboards that can be bought for as little a 60 even giving all that the 5800x3d matches the 12900k in most of your gaming benchmarks,0.6759999990463257,0.3100000023841858,0.014000000432133675

the problem with the 5800x3d in warzone at least is that it offloads anything it cant cache and the lows are extreme which negatively impact any performance gains also gamers nexus saying that a lot of heat problems on latest intel chips coming from the locking device causing uneven contact with heat sinksaio coolers smh,0.8610000014305115,0.13199999928474426,0.00800000037997961
