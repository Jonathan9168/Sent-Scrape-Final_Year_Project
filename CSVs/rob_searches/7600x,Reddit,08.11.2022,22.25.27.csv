5800x3d gets my vote even though its am4 it will still be wicked fast with support of pcie4 and you can apply the savings towards your next upgrade which will probably be in a few years so even better options than the 7600x13600k or other parts,0.004999999888241291,0.04600000008940697,0.9490000009536743
5800x3d is eol but insanely impressive performance with the lowest platform cost out of those 13600k is a budget hedt chips that punches much higher outside of gaming 7600x is the odd one there due to platform cost and the other two cpus sitting on either side of it,0.017000000923871994,0.11400000005960464,0.8690000176429749

if you had an existing am4 build it would be a no brainer but for a fresh build am5 is worth it imo 7600x is already great but if you feel the need down the road youll have access to the x3d models too which will handily leave 13th gen with buyers remorseapart from fanboys,0.01600000075995922,0.15800000727176666,0.8259999752044678

i dont agree for gaming the 7600x is cheaper than the fabled 5800x3d and across a lot of benchmarks its outperforming andor standing its ground just fine 7600 is supposed to be the budget cpu in this gen i think its a fantastic value from all the data ive seen so far,0.0560000017285347,0.2290000021457672,0.7139999866485596

even if the official recommended customer price for the 13600k is like 350 instead of 289 or something thats not exactly horrible given the 14 physical cores its gonna have 4 more than the 12600k would look a lot worse if it was a straight 6core 12thread part like the 7600x i think,0.6610000133514404,0.31200000643730164,0.027000000700354576
looking at 1440p chart is you comparing for gpu performance not cpu performance the gpu they tested with is too slow to show a meaningful performance difference between the chips hence why not just pull up 4k chart since 12300 perform exactly the same as 12600k and 7600x,0.460999995470047,0.5130000114440918,0.026000000536441803
i think the pricing for 7600x and 7700x is disappointing i really like recommending the 150200 dollar r5 5600 and the equivalent intel i5 for most builds amd isnt offering a cpu for a nice 6 core x60 equivalent build,0.800000011920929,0.17499999701976776,0.02500000037252903

from the reviews it doesnt seem like comparing the 13600k to the 7600x is even remotely fair the 13600k wins handily pretty much across the board it being almost 30 cheaper in your market makes the comparison straight up embarrassing for amd,0.8190000057220459,0.16300000250339508,0.01899999938905239

i was somewhat expecting the 7600x to at least have a unanimous every game lead over the 12600k and 12700k but it does not according to really any review so things look a bit grim in that regard as far as gaming performance versus raptor lake id say,0.8029999732971191,0.18299999833106995,0.014000000432133675

first of all 5800x3d is a fake cpu with boosted cache although youre not going to plan to use render programs if you decide to use it one day you will be regretting it because of very weak single coremulti core performance therefore i strongly recommend to you to have 7600x or 13600k,0.8659999966621399,0.125,0.009999999776482582
are we just going to ignore the fact that according to this 12900k is just 4 ahead of 7600x while it isnt exactly the best purchase for the money due to new motherboard ram and such i dont think this is a fair comparison,0.8330000042915344,0.15600000321865082,0.009999999776482582
