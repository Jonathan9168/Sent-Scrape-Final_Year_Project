thanks for the great review i wonder if the 7700x performs at 4k even as good in 1 or even 01 low testing the x3dvcachemodels in spring will be very exciting,0.003000000026077032,0.024000000208616257,0.9729999899864197
i cant wait for the 2700x 3700x 5700x and 7700x comparison although i wont be upgrading anytime soon since im content with my 3700x im just excited on the numbers if ever i upgrade i will be going intel for some reason intel just hits different it just works,0.003000000026077032,0.024000000208616257,0.972000002861023

microcenters got a sweet deal atm if you pair a new am5 ryzen 7 7700x cpu with a compatible motherboard you get free 32gb ram at 6000mhz pretty nice,0.003000000026077032,0.06599999964237213,0.9309999942779541

glad i went with amd for gaming even if its slightly more costly rn also cant wait to upgrade from 7700x to 7800x3d which will dust the 13900ks in games,0.00800000037997961,0.0729999989271164,0.9190000295639038

configuring this 7700x to use less power as for optimum tech latest video and with the slightly better ram configuration as for your tests in the first ryzen 7000 video review this would be a beast for gaming even more,0.007000000216066837,0.08799999952316284,0.9049999713897705

great videowas waiting for thiscurrently i have an i7 8700 on a b360 and a gtx 1080i want to upgrade to something more beefy for gamingif i want to get an rtx 4080 assuming they are available do you think the r7 7700x still makes sense or should i go for the r9 instead,0.004000000189989805,0.09700000286102295,0.8989999890327454

have a feeling the 13900k is about to be the best gaming cpu till the 7700x3d,0.010999999940395355,0.10899999737739563,0.8809999823570251

imo the killer feature here is the 65w eco mode for us sff peeps 90 of the performance for half the power usage sign me up i might have to dive into a 7700x at some point when we see what b650 itx boards launch probably snag a strix b650i if thats in the cards,0.02199999988079071,0.13300000131130219,0.8450000286102295

great review as always on the topic of doing a larger sample size test id probably say dont bother as the 7700x will probably be faster than the 12900k over however many games you decide the real test for the 7700x will be intels 13th gen,0.029999999329447746,0.1770000010728836,0.7929999828338623
12700k is definetly more efficient thanks to the strong ipc from golden cove and the biglittle designa temperature difference of 13ish degrees between the 12700k and 7700x zen 4 core ipc is lower than golden cove that is why it needs almost 1 ghz higher boost clocks for basically the same gaming perfomance,0.020999999716877937,0.24799999594688416,0.7310000061988831

so investing in the new am5 platform just really pays off when getting the 7900x or above the 7700x looks a little weak compared to the 12700k,0.02800000086426735,0.30799999833106995,0.6639999747276306

the 7700x is the one im most interested in but im a patient man so ill wait to see what intel plans to do and how the prices will evolve until the end of the year to decide what to do,0.012000000104308128,0.33500000834465027,0.652999997138977
considering how much mileage i got out of my b450 board going from 2700x to 5950x i think im going to take the leap of faith some time next year and go with am5 once b650e starts hitting reasonable prices and seriously fast gen5 nvme drives are out im really tempted to just pitch my system as is including the 6700xt and go with the 7950x and 7700xt,0.019999999552965164,0.3310000002384186,0.6489999890327454
was going to go intel this go around and pickup a 13700k but ended up getting 32gb of ddr 5 5200 ram free with the purchase of a 7700x so it was a no brainer go ahead and jump to am5,0.02500000037252903,0.35899999737739563,0.6150000095367432

in my opinion if you are building a fully new pc get the 7700x youll have upgrade paths in am5 in the future where your 13700k will be eol on lga1700 this will save hassle in the long run and perhaps money too,0.012000000104308128,0.4020000100135803,0.5860000252723694

it should be 13700k vs 7900x and 13600k vs 7700x i5 wins by a big margin in multithread and probably 13400f vs 7600x once it comes out,0.008999999612569809,0.44600000977516174,0.5450000166893005

hey tech great video here i watched other reviews although the 7700x is a good gaming cpu but the overall platform upgrade and cpu costs made this it not as appealing in price frankly speaking the 5800x3d and 12700k seem to offer similar gaming performances to the 7700x,0.19099999964237213,0.34200000762939453,0.46700000762939453
also if you plan to do emulation the 7700x is better with its avx512 got a 12700k with it fused off and its about a 2030 drop compared to one with avx512,0.0430000014603138,0.5,0.4560000002384186
amd will bring a reason for us the 7800x3d but first they want to feed the people with the other cpus and hoping that many gamers will afterwards sell their 7700x 7900x and 7950x to get the 7800x3d thats their way to do it,0.032999999821186066,0.5429999828338623,0.4230000078678131

this 7700x ryzen cpu is the only one so far which had made me enthusiastic about the whole line up previously it was kinda of a wash but 7700x manages to deliver impressive gaming performance while not costing a fortune it is just these benchmarks are quite useless as i can see raptors approaching i wonder if it is going to survive until the dawn,0.3070000112056732,0.28700000047683716,0.4059999883174896
of course the new intel 13700k is gonna beat the 7700x in most tests its got way more coresor look at it this way intel are having to jam more cores into their cpus just to keep up or beat zen,0.09700000286102295,0.5569999814033508,0.34599998593330383
i was really torn between the 7700x and the 13700k and i decided not to wait for raptor lakes launch and pulled the trigger on the 7700xthese benchmarks confirm that i did make the right choice basically the two chips trade blows from game to game but all while the 7700x consuming a lot less power ,0.13199999928474426,0.5270000100135803,0.3409999907016754
7600x and 7700x are dead on arrival tbhboth the 12600f and 12700f trounce it in mt and are in the same realm in gaming and way cheaper now including everything,0.23100000619888306,0.460999995470047,0.30799999833106995
im using an arctic lf2 280 to cool my 5800x it looks like from what ive been reading that it should be perfectly capable of cooling a 7700x is that correct,0.014000000432133675,0.6809999942779541,0.3050000071525574
this is the kind of review i was looking fora game comparison between the 7700x vs 13700 covering both the usage of ddr4 and ddr5 on intel and how it compares to amdif amd can lower their prices we will have an epic war,0.11999999731779099,0.5920000076293945,0.289000004529953
always remember you buy the am5 mobo probably only once when 8000 and 9000 come around you dont have to lose money reselling your old motherboard thatpower costs makes intel a joke 7700x all the way,0.17499999701976776,0.5540000200271606,0.2709999978542328

as far as i know the intel platformsocket is already endoflife and will be replaced next year so if i had to chose between 13700k and 7700x id still go for amd because the socket is good for a couple of years vice versa if id already had the intel chip from last year of course,0.03400000184774399,0.7310000061988831,0.23499999940395355

very close minimum fps for 7700x compared to 12900k in cyberpunki dont care about max fps just minimum as that causes stutter its why i would go with the 7700x instead of 7600 as it gives 12 more minimum fps,0.29499998688697815,0.5619999766349792,0.14300000667572021
i wonder how 7700x with ddr5 compares in value to 12700k when using ddr4if i upgrade to 12700k or 13700k i can keep my ddr4 if i upgrade to amd i have to swap out my ram i wonder if switching to ddr5 and zen4 will give me a significant benefit compared to ddr412700k in qhd and 4k high refresh rate,0.03400000184774399,0.8299999833106995,0.13699999451637268
you can find 32 gb ddr55600 for half the price of those 6000 sticks id bet the performance drop is minimal but it would bring down the price difference between the 5800x3d and 7700x,0.18400000035762787,0.6850000023841858,0.13099999725818634

as an 10850k owner the 7700x is impressive but not enough to justify an upgrade but the fact that the 7700x is so close to the 12700k and the the 12700k is running at a lesser frequency is concerning raptor lake is around the corner so i feel zen4 could be outclassed by these upcoming cpus,0.4009999930858612,0.5,0.0989999994635582
so if the dif from 5800x to 7700x is 20 and 5800x to 5800x3d is 75 imagine what kind of numbers we gonna see by the 3d models,0.057999998331069946,0.8429999947547913,0.0989999994635582
here in australia theres about a 150 price difference between the 7600x and 7700x makes me think that it would probably be better to go with the 7600x and put the extra 150 towards a better motherboard,0.15600000321865082,0.7670000195503235,0.07800000160932541
unboxed since you are using the optimal memory according to amd for the 7000series wouldnt it be fair to use the optimal memory for 5800x3d 3800mhz cl16 surely that would close the gap up to the 7700x or even overtake it,0.06499999761581421,0.8600000143051147,0.07400000095367432
undervolt this in bios with pbo2 under advanced cpu settingsdo all cores negative and 30 for the 7700xthen set the tpp to 85000mw 85wyou will see similar boosts or better still and a massive drop in power draw and tempsthe 7900 usually can only do 15mv and the wattage is based on the cputhe 7950x is usually set to 180w,0.1899999976158142,0.7400000095367432,0.07100000232458115

surprisingly the 7700x seems to be a better value part for me the 13700k is actually 90 more expensive where i live combined with worse efficency over the years and the fact i dont particularly want to invest in a platform i wont be able to upgrade,0.6759999990463257,0.25699999928474426,0.06700000166893005
this seems to point more to me buying a 7600x instead of the 7700x,0.10199999809265137,0.8309999704360962,0.06700000166893005
why dont you have a 5800x3d to compare to in other comparisons the 5800x3d 1 lows are drastically higher than the 5800x and is comparable to 7700x the 5800x3d is 41900 right now and uses cheaper motherboards and ram,0.4309999942779541,0.503000020980835,0.06599999964237213
how muchwould going from i7 3770k stock 2133mhz to zen 4 be im thinking of going for the 3dv instead of the 7700x,0.057999998331069946,0.8769999742507935,0.06499999761581421
maybe i missed it but is there a reason for the 7700x to be faster than the 7950x in games,0.18199999630451202,0.7570000290870667,0.061000000685453415

i think id still just wait for the 7700x3d on am5 and have an upgrade path in the future vs having to replace my motherboard again to go beyond 13th gen intel which will cost me more in the long run,0.35899999737739563,0.5839999914169312,0.05700000002980232
i planned to build a pc im confused should i go with ryzen 7 7700x or ryzen 9 5900x mostly ill be using for unreal and gaming,0.11299999803304672,0.8309999704360962,0.0560000017285347
my question isshould i jump from 5600x to 5800x3d or just invest in the new am5 platform with a 7700x i must say that after selling the old parts i have to pay an extra 300 to jump to am5 meaning new mb ram and cpuapu all of these paired with a 6900xt,0.16599999368190765,0.7789999842643738,0.054999999701976776
for those with a b450 boards would you suggest an upgrade to a 5800x3d or a 5950x where the only cost is the cpu compared to an upgrade to a 7700x where the cost is the cpu motherboard and ram ,0.04500000178813934,0.9010000228881836,0.05400000140070915
its always hard to judge this stuff for older chips like the 8700k i have ocd to 5ghz for gaming my cpu is still on par with the 5600x but its hard to see what improvement i would get with the 7600x or 7700x without the data in the graphs,0.41499999165534973,0.531000018119812,0.05400000140070915
im sure its not going to be a massive difference but i couldnt help but notice all the top i7s are using ddr5 6400 while the the 7700x7900x is using ddr5 6000 not exactly apples to apples,0.42399999499320984,0.5239999890327454,0.052000001072883606
so 6400mhz ram isnt a thing for 7700x wouldve loved a 1 to 1 comparison,0.4869999885559082,0.4620000123977661,0.050999999046325684

im a little surprised they havent lead out with the 3d cache version of the 7700x straight out of the gate,0.3230000138282776,0.6420000195503235,0.035999998450279236
yeah 7700x isnt really impressing me but if they dropped the 7800x3d tomorrow and it compares to the 7700x the same way a 5800x3d compares to a 5700x then hot damn,0.7049999833106995,0.26100000739097595,0.03400000184774399
you also have to factor in the cost of electricity consumed over time by the core i713700kmb vs ryzen 7 7700xmb systems,0.11999999731779099,0.847000002861023,0.032999999821186066

after this test i have to reevaluate my initial negative impression about the 7700x it makes much more sense now after seeing these unexpected results unfortunately as far as it concerns 4k gaming there is no need to go from zen 2 yet unless the new video cards from nvidia and amd expose some significant shortcomings when compared to newer models,0.7170000076293945,0.2619999945163727,0.02199999988079071
