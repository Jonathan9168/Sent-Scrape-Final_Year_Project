yeah i think so a win over gane would still make it difficult to argue jones isnt the best fighter of all time though besides the peds argument of course but i personally believe that all the top fighters are either on them currently or have been at some point in their career wouldnt be surprised if jones was just much more reckless about it,0.14100000262260437,0.7350000143051147,0.12399999797344208

jones fights are exhaustingfirst you have to wait until fight is announced then you have to wait until he is absolutely in the cage and not in jail then even after the fight you have to wait that he doesnt pop and invalidate the whole thing,0.6740000247955322,0.3100000023841858,0.017000000923871994
