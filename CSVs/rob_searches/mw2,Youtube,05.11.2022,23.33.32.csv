the ui is terrible but i remember that everyone was complaining in cold war and vanguard that the ui stayed the same as mw2019 i think they only changed it up due to that feedback overall i think what those people failed to realize is that you can only have ui in either vertical or horizontal and vertical is def the way to go,0.8730000257492065,0.11900000274181366,0.00800000037997961
