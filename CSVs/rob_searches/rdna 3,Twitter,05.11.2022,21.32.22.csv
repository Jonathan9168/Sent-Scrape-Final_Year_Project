after watching amds rdna 3 announcement im def excited to see 3rd party reviews price wise these look promising atm but it will ultimately come down to how these perform against 40series fingers crossed for the mid range cards,0.0020000000949949026,0.035999998450279236,0.9620000123977661
these new rdna 3 cards are looking pretty good,0.0020000000949949026,0.035999998450279236,0.9610000252723694
rdna 3 is a bomb the best part is that the midrange 7800xt is competing with 4090 also they can still scale higher than the present highest release,0.004999999888241291,0.039000000804662704,0.9559999704360962
however the best thing claimed is an increase in power efficiency it is achieving a 17x performance boost with 10 more power than the rx 6950 xt hopefully the efficiency curve is good for overclockingundervolting i really want to see the mobile rdna 3 chipschiplets,0.004000000189989805,0.0430000014603138,0.953000009059906
im ok with the price of vr2 its actually cheaper than i thought but i get the kneejerk reaction amd had a nice show yesterday rdna 3 looks sweet ps5 pro and xsx2 on the way,0.00800000037997961,0.050999999046325684,0.9409999847412109

i think rdna 3 banking on people also having a 7000 series cpu is an interesting move and im ready for the competition,0.004000000189989805,0.07999999821186066,0.9160000085830688
amd going in the low clock way i see with zen 4c being 35ghz they can transition to making a high ipc cpu with mobile library with rdna 3 they can transition to making a compact high ipc gpu with mobile library too love it,0.004000000189989805,0.08100000023841858,0.9150000214576721
rdna 3 is being reported by a lot of credible people as being 2x stronger than rdna 2 which will probably be true thanks to its multichip design and will probably be cheaper because of the multichip design hope it at least is similar to 4090 if not beat it in some games,0.006000000052154064,0.07900000363588333,0.9139999747276306
lisa su we will launch our nextgeneration rdna 3 gpus later this week with fivenanometer chiplet designs our rdna 3 gpus will deliver strong increases in performance and performance per watt and include new features supporting high resolution high frame rate gaming,0.0020000000949949026,0.08900000154972076,0.9089999794960022
from the moment rdna 3 was confirmed to be a chiplet design price to performance would go to amd so much cheaper and better yields if they can make a brakethough in raytracing and fsr 3 is good rdna 4 may take the performance crown,0.008999999612569809,0.0820000022649765,0.9079999923706055
really looking forward to amds information and claims for rdna 3 therell probably be some growing pains with the chiplet design like with with zen if they can pull off the interconnects as seamlessly as apple did with their m1 ultra with two m1 max chips then ,0.004999999888241291,0.0989999994635582,0.8960000276565552

feeling pretty happy i held off buying an rtx3000 or rdna 2 card until now rdna 3 performance looks good doesnt melt cables and undercuts the 4080 by 200 cant complain,0.019999999552965164,0.09099999815225601,0.8889999985694885

for the older card and 300 watts for the younger one and this in turn is a consequence of the improved energy efficiency of the rdna 3 architecture amd itself says that energy efficiency has increased by 54 another important feature is support for the latest displayport,0.003000000026077032,0.12399999797344208,0.8730000257492065

it is noteworthy that amd announced during the event the next generation of graphics cards rx 7900 xtx and rx 7900 xt which are the first to support the new rdna 3 architecture which means that they use a chip design similar to the companys ryzen processors,0.0020000000949949026,0.19599999487400055,0.8019999861717224

 i hope amds pricing strategy for rdna 3 really sticks it to the competition come on give people a reason to get excited and give you market share nvidia is practically handing you the market if you can make the smart decisions,0.029999999329447746,0.210999995470047,0.7590000033378601

if the new intel cards were available in a tier or two higher id be considering it im replacing my 1080 and want it to last at least as long as it did ive been unimpressed with nvidia this time around so im happy to deal with early adopter issues with rdna 3,0.054999999701976776,0.2849999964237213,0.6600000262260437
rdna 2 was already incredibly close in raster and rdna 3 will continue that if not be outright better if the rumors leaks are to be trusted esp at perfw as for laptop im betting heavily on dragon range for the high perf laptops ffs it will be 16 cores at the top,0.03099999949336052,0.31700000166893005,0.6520000100135803

for sure we can reduce it on the rdna 3 as well well have to see how muchif any performance loss guess only the reviews from independent media will settle that looking forward to that day ,0.028999999165534973,0.375,0.5960000157356262

i think ive finally reached the point where my radv fragment shader interlock implementation is fully working but a bit suboptimal not ending the critical section until the end of the shader not narrowing it to memory accesses in it except rdna 3 changed everything ,0.07999999821186066,0.3630000054836273,0.5569999814033508
wow wasnt expecting fsr 30 already didnt say much about it other than just 2x perf improvement over fsr 20 will it be supported on older hw and 3rd party hw will it be making use of rdna 3s ai hw but ay love that were already getting a dlss 3 competitor,0.11599999666213989,0.3319999873638153,0.5519999861717224

yeah its for strix but i also think that after taking l from nvidia they might release rdna 3 for consumers when 4090ti launches also i have seen an interview where they say that 3ghz is possible with rdna 3 which means that with faster memory and ic they can compete with,0.006000000052154064,0.48899999260902405,0.5049999952316284
knowing that there are multiple gtx 1060 for 100€ on ebay i might actually be able to buy this soon if i sell my card and also i dont care about getting an rdna 3 card i have a 1080 60hz monitor so the 6700 is already a bit overkill,0.03400000184774399,0.4620000123977661,0.5049999952316284

i comment from a rx6800 owner perspective so no fanboyism here but running the 4090 at 70 power target 315w doesnt lose almost any performance there are plenty videos showcasing this so the rdna 3 if it comes in at 350w or so it may lose even at the 350w power target,0.1420000046491623,0.6779999732971191,0.18000000715255737

rdna 3 phoenix apus i have the feeling that the 7700g desktop will be a rembrandt based one like amds initial zen apu cadence 6nm dies would make sense there and amd will perhaps drop it in the 320 bracket for the rdna2 igpu with more headroom,0.024000000208616257,0.8040000200271606,0.1720000058412552

i think rdna 3 can gain market share with navi 31 at 900 navi 32 at 600 navi 33 at 300 and nvidia market share in mobile is going to disappear in notebooks lost to both intel and amd,0.25,0.6150000095367432,0.13500000536441803
but we can also reduce the power target of rdna 3 for it to consume even less while not loosing a lot of performance right,0.14000000059604645,0.7279999852180481,0.13199999928474426

yea i have a feeling performance wise its gonna be behing ada if the leaks were true about rdna 3 being 2x in performance then rdna 2 then maybe itll match ada but it doesnt seem to be 2x more around 17x,0.11800000071525574,0.7549999952316284,0.12700000405311584

120k units sold is piss in the wind for a gpu company revenue even at 1600 a piece you people easily forget that radeon survived with rx 480 in a market totally dominated by nvidia with rdna 3 they can take the mainstream tier and gain at least 20 more market share,0.35199999809265137,0.5590000152587891,0.08900000154972076

close but if amds own figures show a 510 lead for the 4090 in most cases then i highly doubt on avrg that rdna 3 wont be closer to 10 worse than the 4090 a lot of games that amd chose have historically amd advantages from stuff like drivers like ac valhalla and rdr2,0.421999990940094,0.527999997138977,0.05000000074505806

i have no idea with the current prices in theory they could undercut nvidia on the top end as rdna 3 uses a chiplet design which would give then higher yields but its gen1 of this approach so could be more expensive early on,0.36800000071525574,0.5899999737739563,0.041999999433755875

nvidia could have cut power use by 50w under the most strenuous games i could find while only sacrificing 3 performance on average or it could have shipped a 320w part with 95 of the 4k ultra performance hubris or just trying to build a buffer between ada and rdna 3,0.5860000252723694,0.37400001287460327,0.03999999910593033

some of you may wonder why is jensen so confident that rdna3 is a flop thats why he is jacking up prices upping sku naming massively no this is an invitation to lisa su for to not price war just slot in rdna 3 skus at absurd price tiers both win,0.5860000252723694,0.3779999911785126,0.03500000014901161
thats a heck of a lot of a premium tho i wouldnt justify the price of rdna 3 if it was like the rumored prices which were around 1200 thats 600 between the 4090 and rdna 3 man,0.6399999856948853,0.32499998807907104,0.03500000014901161

not expecting much from amd today i imagine the chiplet transition for its gpus is gonna be alot more rough than it was for its cpus if were lucky amd will tie nvidia again but im expecting the 4090 will at least have a decent margin against whatever the rdna 3 flagship is,0.593999981880188,0.3720000088214874,0.03400000184774399

they decided to not go for top performanxe with the launch of rdna 3 which might be smart in the market and situation right now the cards will very likely sell out anyway so why show everything you have for higher cost already,0.5009999871253967,0.46799999475479126,0.029999999329447746
we shall see but apparently the pic the other day of a 2 8 pin rdna 3 card was the reference rx 7900xtx which means it pulls 375w max while the reference 4090 pulls 450w thats why it looses some aib 7900xtx have 3 8 pins to pull up to 550w those will beat 4090,0.26100000739097595,0.7099999785423279,0.028999999165534973

yeah as much as im on hopium for rdna 3 to be exceptional from the priceperf perspective the gut feeling tells me that theyll disappoint yet again with this upcoming launch by pricing their cards way too close to nv counterparts which even with all the nv adapter drama,0.7459999918937683,0.2290000021457672,0.02500000037252903
