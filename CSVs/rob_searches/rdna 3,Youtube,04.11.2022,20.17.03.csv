youre right paul rdna 3 looks very promising and i am really looking forward to its release its been a long time coming and im convinced the end product will have been worth the wait cant wait to hear your views upon release great vids as always keep up the good work ,0.0020000000949949026,0.00800000037997961,0.9900000095367432

rdna 3 hit exactly where i was hoping in performance in a 350 watt envelope the price actually exceeded my expectations i think rdna 3 going to be a hell of a value this generation across the board cant wait to see what they release in the mid range as well,0.003000000026077032,0.01600000075995922,0.9810000061988831
i think ill hang on to my thermalenhanced 3080 founders for now but this is very exciting to see amd catching up this quickly hopefully their drivers are solid as well and we really will have a serious competition on our hands,0.0020000000949949026,0.017999999225139618,0.9800000190734863

as a long time 1080ti enjoyer im really happy about rdna3 right now not planning on upgrading my gpu in the near future but its good to know that it would be a straight forward upgrade without the need to change my psu which i got for the 1080ti cables and case lets hope that the launch benchmarks see amd deliver the performance they promise,0.004999999888241291,0.029999999329447746,0.9649999737739563

rdna 3 is actually very impressive especially when you take into factor the price i assume the lower than expected prices is due to the lower cost of manufacturing these cards i can also see amd doing a refresh in the future with much higher clocks and more infinity cache the low clocks actually surprised me tbh,0.004999999888241291,0.0430000014603138,0.953000009059906
hopefully amd gives us an x3d zen 4 soon looking forward to upgrading my 58003080 to a full amd system next year,0.0020000000949949026,0.04899999871850014,0.9480000138282776
"rdna3 has been much better then i expected not only does it have a great price going for xtx it has all the features youd want plus fsr30 looming the power requirements are also quite good considering the competition ive always been super disappointed in the 40 series just junk
getting disappointed about rt performance is kind of silly ",0.01899999938905239,0.041999999433755875,0.9390000104904175

it is not dissapointing actually its quite amazing i love both lovelace and rnda3 and think the improvment is amazing people are just dissapointed because they had early rumors saying that performance would be 25 3x which was never possible unless they had best 3nm and faster memory with more shaders,0.023000000044703484,0.05700000002980232,0.9200000166893005

belender does support amd radeon cards with hip since blender version 30 which they worked closely with amd to create although nvidas optix denoiser exclusive to nvidia is miles better than the openimagedenoise which is the one and is such with love the videos keep up the great work,0.006000000052154064,0.08399999886751175,0.9100000262260437

rdna 3 is a beast look how many compute cores they have managed to cram in there and only running at 350w also remember the cores and mem are uncoupled with frequency so the compute cores prob run pretty fast amd really are onto something here and i think for the first time in a long time the gpu market might have some competition,0.009999999776482582,0.0860000029206276,0.9039999842643738

the amazing thing about this is that in the future they can make the die bigger with 300mm more space they can up the power requirements and with their chiplet design they can stack memory 1 or 2 high what can nvidia do theyre pretty much maxed out,0.010999999940395355,0.12700000405311584,0.8619999885559082

i am happy with it i waited through the crisis to upgrade and this looks worthy its hilarious how the ampere pricing has stagnated for months and one can get a 7900xt for 100 more than a 3080 at this point apart from the 4090 for the top there isnt a single good nvidia card currently at its price point,0.04500000178813934,0.10400000214576721,0.8519999980926514

ok before asking the question first of all hello i really like your videos having said that i would like to ask you in your opinion the new amd xtx will be fine on 13 gen intel or the performances they presented will be based only in the amd emobo sorry about the mistakes of the english but im italian,0.007000000216066837,0.1899999976158142,0.8019999861717224

couple take aways for me one thing amd has in their back pocket is 1usmus and the rmp on hydra software with this software nearly a one click tune for 15 more performance also this launch really is going to hit nvidia hard for any card over 700 it does look like the 7900xtx will have better rt than 3090ti so is a small step,0.019999999552965164,0.3230000138282776,0.6570000052452087

yeah just doing some nampkin math we should be seeing just 80 more perf in the top n33 chip from just shader count alone 2x 6900xt perf is totally doable with the extra bandwidth clock speed and infinity cache,0.012000000104308128,0.3330000042915344,0.6549999713897705
really looking like the 5800x3d 7900xtx is going to be a nice combination for price to performance for gaming amds zen4 and nvidias 4000 series are both just too expensive for many to adopt right now,0.04600000008940697,0.30399999022483826,0.6499999761581421
truth is nvidia has cuda and cuda is king i have a 3080 and ill never pay more than 700us for a card so ill wait untill they release another 700us800us card and if it beats the 4080 ill get it,0.039000000804662704,0.3109999895095825,0.6499999761581421
of course ampere was a pyrrhic victory like you said tom nvidia had to pull out all the stops to beat amd powersizenew process nvidia would have been much happier with a turing like line up little performance uplift and smaller chips using low power rant over rdna3 looks awesome amd pulls out the trump card chiplets,0.03999999910593033,0.31200000643730164,0.6480000019073486
recent rumors are suggesting that the 7900xt not the xtx will be 4090 level raster if the xtx is 350w it seems like there might be some amazing headroom to just crush whatever nvidias response is any updates on their hybrid rt thing,0.02199999988079071,0.3449999988079071,0.6330000162124634

lets go amd 350 watt and 95 performance of 4090 would be more then enough for me specially since you can actually fit them inside existing cases,0.013000000268220901,0.36000001430511475,0.6269999742507935

my plan is to build a straight amd rig when their new x3d launches so if theyre going to release a 7950 i hope it lines up near to that,0.00800000037997961,0.3790000081062317,0.6129999756813049
being 21 as a kid growing up we had the amd athalon ii which lasted us quite a long time my first gaming build was a ryzen 3 1200 paired with an 8gb rx 570 armor oc im currently upgrade to a ryzen 7 5700g and my rtx 3090 should be getting here soon but hopefully when its time to upgrade again i wont have to mix and match ,0.006000000052154064,0.39500001072883606,0.6000000238418579

amd made a good choice keep power cooler size and most importantly price sane winning in rt and by a slim margin in raster is not worth 600 to any consumer who isnt already sold on nvidia regardless this also means prices could be good lower down the stack later which would bode well for value not to mention the lower prices of rdna 2,0.032999999821186066,0.37400001287460327,0.5929999947547913

its never double nor 3 or 4 times of the performance of the past generation it doesnt matter what they tell you it may be up to 50 faster but thats about as high as you can expect i do love amd though this is not a fanboy comment,0.09099999815225601,0.34200000762939453,0.5669999718666077
the 4090 is about 50 more performance per watt than the 3090ti,0.028999999165534973,0.40700000524520874,0.5640000104904175
if rt performance is better than my 3090 by a decent margin thats a win 7900xtx is knocking on 4090 raster performance for 600 cheaper and more importantly uses lower power aka is easier to cool and quieter which is my primary concern,0.1080000028014183,0.33000001311302185,0.5619999766349792
the 7900xtx at 1000 is probably going to be better priceperf than 6900xt at 660 thats 52 more expensive for 60 more perf plus better power efficiency features etc seems like an easy choice for me if you have the money i just dont see the value in the current rdna 2 prices the 6900xt would have to come down to like 500 to be worth considering imo,0.06300000101327896,0.4180000126361847,0.5189999938011169
nvidia is still valued at 3x amd market cap so amd has a lot of room to grow intel used to be 2x amds market cap but amd has caught up after focusing a lot on cpus,0.017999999225139618,0.4819999933242798,0.5

my guess here is amd is going to let aibs push overclocked 450w 3ghz models of the xtx and keep the reference cards targeted as high performance for low cost and i think thats why they did not show any performance comparisons in their show aside from 25ghz and 17 raster over the previous flagship,0.2630000114440918,0.699999988079071,0.03700000047683716

tom ampere being a pyrrhic victory for nvidia is still on the table because they still have so many of them in stock many profits they made selling to miners may be wiped out on those inventory writedowns like in the last mining bubble theyre also holding back 4090 sales for that reason which is also hurting their window before rdna3 hits,0.5950000286102295,0.37400001287460327,0.03200000151991844
it would be crazy to buy a 4080 right now if rdna3 performance is close as it looks its going to be way overpriced 4090 will remain the best for the time being but you are going to pay for it 1600 rrp but in uk they are £2000 ouch,0.8019999861717224,0.16699999570846558,0.03099999949336052

the real problem for nvidia here is that the new amd cards also compete with the huge ampere stock pricewise who on earth is buying a 3080 ti when you can get a new gen 7900 xt for almost the same price,0.6890000104904175,0.2840000092983246,0.027000000700354576

alternative reason for amd to not taking their beloved route of overoverclocking is that n31 just cant clock higher than 25ghz,0.5400000214576721,0.4399999976158142,0.019999999552965164
think long term but amd really needs to start releasing more sooner too the december 13th release date is unacceptable for a company that aspires to become the gpu leader release the better value card before your opponent can counter even for a few weeks or months you can say that you were 1 for awhile,0.7639999985694885,0.21699999272823334,0.01899999938905239

the real issue with the performance of rdna3 is the interconnect to the mcds thats why they decided not to go for 192mb ic and also decided to go with lower clock speeds they cant gain any more performance as long as they cant uplift the memory bandwith on the infinity fabric and that will be the refresh,0.8309999704360962,0.1599999964237213,0.008999999612569809
