i have a 4070 ti and i love it i play cyberpunk at 1440p with dlss 3 quality with all the settings on psycho including rtx and the fps is consistently above 120personally raytracing and dlss3 is worth the extra money for me i also do rendering as a hobby and amd is a non starterif you dont care about rt just save the cash and get the 6950xt,0.004999999888241291,0.028999999165534973,0.9660000205039978
agreed i cant wait to see what they have in store for battlemage if they can release an upper midrange card that gets close or even beats the 7700 xt and rtx 4070 intel will have a winner on its hands,0.0020000000949949026,0.04800000041723251,0.9490000009536743
i think there is really big stock of the rtx 4070 because basically all major pc shops in my country now have the rtx 4070 as the top selling gpu of the month,0.004999999888241291,0.11699999868869781,0.878000020980835
i mentioned the rtx 4070 the 6800 is the best value in gpus today i am not claiming otherwise i agree,0.019999999552965164,0.24799999594688416,0.7319999933242798
 you could theoretically run a 7800x3d and a rtx 4070 build on a 350w power supplyim keen to see which aibs come out with a single 8pin reveling in the possibility of a return for main stream halfheight and low profile cards,0.009999999776482582,0.3889999985694885,0.6019999980926514
i think the 7900 xt is more like 25 faster than a 6900 xt i think you mean the 6950 xtbut i stated above at 799 this 4070 ti will prob be the best card to settle on smaller and much more power efficient 3090 ti with dlss3 prob better rt new from store with a warranty sounds pretty good compared to a 2020 rtx 3080 10 gb for 699,0.03099999949336052,0.4230000078678131,0.5460000038146973
it really depends on what you want to do with your pc if youre strictly just gaming then the 6950xt wouldnt be a bad choice but if you want to do more gamingstreaming have all those nice rtx features its really up to you i personally would go for the 4070 ti my current rig has an rtx 3070 with an i5 12600k ,0.02199999988079071,0.49399998784065247,0.48399999737739563
nvidia rtx 4070 ti fastest gpu under 800 only comparable to intel arc a770 and older cards according to techpowerup a770 offers only 45 of the performance of rtx 4070 ti,0.029999999329447746,0.5770000219345093,0.3930000066757202
 4070ti for 12 more money at base msrpyeah well and the rtx 4070 ti ends up to 35x faster than the rtx 3080 12 gb graphics card4070 ti has no reference model so there is at least 50 mark up than msrp the 7900 xt on the other hand doespls stop believing jensen bs narative,0.07199999690055847,0.593999981880188,0.33500000834465027
wow rtx 4070 consumes less powerthan rx 6700 xt 230wnice job,0.34599998593330383,0.4300000071525574,0.22300000488758087
i9 13900k and rtx 4070ti,0.013000000268220901,0.7680000066757202,0.21899999678134918
rtx 5070 coming for 800 and 4070ti performance but it has dlss4,0.08699999749660492,0.734000027179718,0.17900000512599945
its not like amd is a vram charity they mock for now but i bet the rx 7600 will have 8gb same as 4060 and rx 7700 will have 12gb same as rtx 4070,0.12200000137090683,0.7570000290870667,0.12200000137090683
is the rtx 4070 ti better than a rx 5700 xt,0.050999999046325684,0.8330000042915344,0.11699999868869781
the 3090 wasnt even the top end card the 3090ti was the 3070 matches or beats a titan rtx the 1070 matches or beats the titan x maxwell the 2070 super roughly matches a 1080tititan x pascal so shouldnt the 4070ti at least match a 3090ti or be even better than that considering its the ti and not the nonti,0.12200000137090683,0.7670000195503235,0.1120000034570694
how does this compare for 3080 12 gb not a lot of reviews testing comparing the 4070 with the 3080 12 gb saw a few benchmarks and looks like the 12 gb beats the rtx 4070 maybe because of the bigger memory bus width,0.10000000149011612,0.796999990940094,0.10199999809265137
maybe a dumb question but if i were to build a rtx 4xxx series right now what would be my best bang for buck options is it still the 4090 because after seeing some 4070 reviews i keep getting steered towards the 4080 for my build eek,0.3269999921321869,0.5789999961853027,0.09399999678134918
did you read the articleit does compares to pricing of other chinese productsthe rtx 4070 ti price should start at 7000 rmb which is around 25 cheaper than rtx 4080 16gb at launchthe 7200 rmb price is almost identical to what was expected to be the price of rtx 4080 12gb model before it was canceled,0.06300000101327896,0.847000002861023,0.09000000357627869
here is toms hardwares 15 games average comparison using a mix of both dxr enabledrasterization only benchmarksto imply rtx 4070 and 6800xt by perform similarly by focusing solely on rasterization is very misleading thats all i am saying,0.6729999780654907,0.3100000023841858,0.017000000923871994
and their card is 100 more expensive already so this is the bare fucking minimum not to mention that looking good up against the rtx 4070 ti is a very low bar,0.9359999895095825,0.0560000017285347,0.00800000037997961
