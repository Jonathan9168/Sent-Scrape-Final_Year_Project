"by now we all know the msrp for the upcoming rtx 4000 cards the general sentiment is that theyre too expensive

it gets worse when you actually see the relative perfomance slides they are not just expensive they are super duper expensive for what it seems not even 2025 uplift",0.7749999761581421,0.21199999749660492,0.012000000104308128
how the hell do you price a 4070 12gb 100 more than a 3080 12gb in 2022 jensen smoking damn rocks but the killer part is aib gpus are gonna be higher than fes as we all know wait till they announce their bs prices,0.8790000081062317,0.10999999940395355,0.010999999940395355
nothing about nvidia is responsive when this is literally a backpedal i wouldnt think you wanted nvidia to try launching the 4070 as a 4080 12gb in the first place right righting a wrong is a good step yes but it sounds like youre forgetting the context of this response by nvidia,0.8090000152587891,0.18000000715255737,0.010999999940395355
this is just gonna add cost to an already costly card everything that has a 4080 on it has to be reprinted new boxes and time it takes to do all that seems dumb,0.843999981880188,0.14499999582767487,0.010999999940395355
even then the 4080 16gb looks like shit it really seems like the 12gb is a 4060 ti and 16gb is a 4070ti,0.8820000290870667,0.10700000077486038,0.010999999940395355
the biggest problem for me is how unpolished the fan cutouts are they just look off either way i do hope that this is fake because im still hoping for a 2 slot 4080 design,0.875,0.11400000005960464,0.010999999940395355
the problem is there is years worth of ampere and rdna2 supply in the retail channel right now because of the mining crash and overproduction rdna3 and rtx 40 will be an artificially more expensive generation simply due to sunk costboth companies have to get rid of a ton of existing supply,0.8090000152587891,0.17900000512599945,0.010999999940395355
i agree that the cut down cores on the 4080 junior is a nasty marketing trick havent seen that one pulled before,0.8820000290870667,0.1080000028014183,0.009999999776482582
it looked like a tainted treat from the start a card almost designed to get shit on by enthusiasts and funnily enough the one nvidia let aibs have for themselves this must be disappointing for all the premade builders though im sure lenovo was ready to sell a ton of pcs with 4080s in them,0.8960000276565552,0.0949999988079071,0.009999999776482582

even the fake 4080 is terrible value never mind the 300 more expensive actual 4080,0.9300000071525574,0.061000000685453415,0.008999999612569809
i wonder how angry some of the aibs will be about this they likely already created alot of marketing material boxes manuals with the 4080 12gb branding now they will either have to recreate it or slap a sticker on it,0.8220000267028809,0.16899999976158142,0.008999999612569809

hope the tech media wont let nvidia of the hook when 4080 16gb review rolls around its still a way too cutdown and overpriced card this was just a straight scam however,0.8809999823570251,0.10999999940395355,0.008999999612569809
the guy you replied to specifically said the 12gb version and you said it was 1200 which is wrong,0.7599999904632568,0.23199999332427979,0.00800000037997961
i wonder if its less the media backlash against that prompted this and more realizing that they would look really dumb having a 4080 potentially competing against amds midrange if a 7600xt or 7700 somehow comes close it would be a really bad look,0.8489999771118164,0.14399999380111694,0.00800000037997961
i dont get it everyone says the 12gb 4080 is shit so nvidia is doing something about it and now everyones giving them shit for that too,0.8949999809265137,0.09700000286102295,0.00800000037997961

that would actually be worse than having two 4080s with different specifications that would just seem like they increased the price of the 4070 anything less than a name change and price reduction wouldnt work,0.8659999966621399,0.125,0.00800000037997961
seriously there have been gpu variants where the vram is doubled but its otherwise the same chip what even the hell is that 4080 12g just insulting,0.8759999871253967,0.11699999868869781,0.007000000216066837
having two gpus with the 4080 designation is confusing arent they doing a refresh with just that kind of bullshit for the 3k series right now d,0.828000009059906,0.164000004529953,0.007000000216066837
"the fact that its also just a short article with no further details and then they uploaded user pictures of people at microcenter and a 4090 strapped into a car just makes it seem so unbelievable obviously its from nvidia themselves but this is such a bizarre way to handle the situation

imagine if they phrased it as aborting the 4080 12gb launch",0.8240000009536743,0.16899999976158142,0.007000000216066837
agreed its super abrupt very short and offers zero insight about how the existing supply of 4080 12gb cards will be handled doesnt this news really screw over board partners that now have a ton of supply they have to rebrand or shift around somehow,0.8659999966621399,0.12700000405311584,0.007000000216066837
no but the 4080 16 gb is a scam also in both pricing naming and performance it just so happened the 4080 12 gb was the bigger scam,0.9229999780654907,0.07100000232458115,0.007000000216066837

they are fucked either way if they renamed it and changed the price people will just complain about how they tried to scam all of us by naming it 4080 in the first place if they kept the price no one would buy a 70 series for that price,0.9139999747276306,0.07999999821186066,0.004999999888241291
