calling it now geforce rtx 4080 12gb will be 2x the raster performance of gtx 1080 ti at the same power draw thats going to be a great upgrade for anyone holding out and not wanting to upgrade their entire system or psu,0.008999999612569809,0.07500000298023224,0.9160000085830688
nvidia decides to unlaunch the rtx 4080 12gb version cant wait to see on shelves soon under the name rtx 4070,0.004000000189989805,0.09799999743700027,0.8989999890327454

its the only card worth buying this gen its a monster of all monsters its eating 4k alive the fastest cpus cant evne keep up its worth the 1600 its the biggest leap in performance ever seen the other cards rtx 4080 16gb and rtx 4080 12gb aka 4070 are garbage,0.061000000685453415,0.11299999803304672,0.8259999752044678

the unlaunching of the geforce rtx 4080 12gb will not only result in a new name for this ad104based graphics card but also more importantly its a chance for a more acceptable price for this 70class sku,0.007000000216066837,0.2840000092983246,0.7089999914169312
on friday nvidia posted on its geforce news site the rtx 4080 12gb is a fantastic graphics card but its not named right having two gpus with the 4080 designations is confusing so were pressing the unlaunch button on the 4080 12gb 22 #nvidia #tech #news,0.04600000008940697,0.33799999952316284,0.6169999837875366
the rtx 4080 12gb is a fantastic graphics card but its not named right having two gpus with the 4080 designation is confusing a bit of both i guess,0.1420000046491623,0.27000001072883606,0.5879999995231628
haha yes they have unannounced rtx 4080 12gb model,0.006000000052154064,0.4129999876022339,0.5809999704360962
the rtx 4080 12gb is a fantastic graphics card but its not named right having two gpus with the 4080 designation is confusing save that line to throw back to them in the not to distant future im sure,0.17100000381469727,0.29100000858306885,0.5379999876022339
we did it gamers the rtx 4080 12gb will be renamed rtx 4070 and still cost 900 dollars,0.04399999976158142,0.492000013589859,0.46299999952316284
 nvidia actually listened and adjusted the rtx 4080 12gb is a fantastic graphics card but its not named right having two gpus with the 4080 designation is confusing nvidia says in a surprisingly concise blog post,0.13199999928474426,0.4230000078678131,0.4449999928474426

you do realize even current gen amd has better pricing than ada the rtx 4080 12gb will offer 3080 ti 3090 perf at 899 the rx 6900 xt already offers that for 699 rdna3 should decimate rtx 40 pricing,0.03400000184774399,0.6140000224113464,0.3529999852180481

if the rtx 4080 12gb gets rebranded as something like the rtx 4080 lite i can kinda accept that,0.01600000075995922,0.699999988079071,0.2840000092983246
i bet that in a few years rtx 4080 12gb will go for unicorn prices because they had such a limited run,0.12600000202655792,0.6079999804496765,0.26499998569488525
nvidia canceling the rtx 4080 12gb is the funniest thing today e be like say rants outrage and backlash do have effects when the voice is unanimous,0.3499999940395355,0.4099999964237213,0.23999999463558197
rtx 4080 12gb which according to many thematic resources should have been called rtx 4070 will perform at the level of rtx 3090 and rtx 3090 ti depending on the game the older rtx 4080 16gb will already easily bypass the nvidia flagship of the last generation although the,0.06400000303983688,0.7279999852180481,0.20900000631809235

this is actually really good because they kept getting away with this for years they were literally misleading buyers rtx 4080 12gb didnt just have less memory than than 16gb at all it was essentially 4070 but named 4080,0.48899999260902405,0.32100000977516174,0.1889999955892563

the cheapest 40series card now starts at checks notes 1199 just weeks after unveiling its 40series cards powered by the allnew ada lovelace architecture nvidia said friday it was pulling the plug on the rtx 4080 12gb before the card had even hit store,0.054999999701976776,0.7749999761581421,0.17000000178813934

turns out that rtx 4080 12gb and rtx 4080 16gb are entirely different chips too not just a few cuda cores and bus lanes disabled but a completely different die such a bold move to give them the same name ,0.1080000028014183,0.7279999852180481,0.164000004529953
the nvidia rtx 4080 12gb is just a rtx 4070 its good to see they got enough backlash on this obvious scam to cancel the 4080 12gb launch,0.44999998807907104,0.4000000059604645,0.15000000596046448
the end rtx 4080 12gb confidently outstrips rtx 3090 ti by 1520 and rtx 4080 16gb is faster than rtx 3090 ti by 3045 the results in microsoft flight simulator should not be considered together with the rest since dlss 2 does not work well in this game,0.36899998784065247,0.49900001287460327,0.13199999928474426

lol the rtx 4080 12gb unlaunch maybe therell be a snyder cut style campaign demanding it rerelease as the 4070,0.15399999916553497,0.7440000176429749,0.10199999809265137
yeah but i miss the time when a titan used to cost 999 and everyone knows that people were complaining about the rtx 4080 12gb price not the 4090 in fact the 4090 seemed like the most reasonable card in that family,0.39100000262260437,0.5059999823570251,0.10199999809265137

im glad that theyre rescinding the releasename of the rtx 4080 12gb but this is absolutely not the only time theyve tried to squeeze out extra money from consumers by using shadyactually illegal methods fanboyism2stronk sometimes,0.492000013589859,0.4180000126361847,0.09000000357627869
at least #nvidia have done the right thing now and scrapped the rtx 4080 12gb version theyve realized it was a bad naming convention,0.4490000009536743,0.4620000123977661,0.08900000154972076

the rtx 4080 12gb is a fantastic graphics card but its not named right having two gpus with the 4080 designation is confusing they needed public backlash to figure that one out yeah sure either they are incompetent or tried to pull one over on the customers have a guess,0.6880000233650208,0.2290000021457672,0.08299999684095383
same if you have 900 gpu money people in that category have 1200 usually the reason rtx 4090 is underpriced and 16gb 4080 is pretty much squared rtx 4080 12gb was reported to have huge margins at 900 i doubt any price drops happen at all,0.38100001215934753,0.5400000214576721,0.07900000363588333

yea thats tough i suspect they decide to call it rtx 4080 12gb because folks would be mad at a 899 rtx 4070 so yea maybe rtx 4070 ti rtx 4078 lol,0.3479999899864197,0.5789999961853027,0.0729999989271164

i hope nvidia is helping out their aib partners after cancelling the launch of the rtx 4080 12gb the cards probably already exist and are in packaging thats so much product that has to be rebranded and priced down without knowing if theyll be able to release it soon,0.4560000002384186,0.47600001096725464,0.06700000166893005

my original comment was in response to someone who thought the rtx 4080 12gb would get a price cut when introduced as rtx 4070 which is also pretty insane nutballs on both sides i guess ,0.49399998784065247,0.44600000977516174,0.05999999865889549

 hi msi i would appreciate an official statement for a feature around the recent change in gpu line up by nvidia they discontinued the rtx 4080 12gb sku how would that impact msi what is msis stance on this step were there any gpus already in production thank you,0.18799999356269836,0.7580000162124634,0.05299999937415123

i see people calling the rtx 4080 12gb a 4070 when its closer to a 4060ti the difference between the 16gb and 12gb model is 23 at best if you check userbenchmark the difference between a 3080 and the 3070 is 11 and for a 3080 vs a 3060ti its 19,0.26499998569488525,0.6850000023841858,0.050999999046325684

nvidia cancels the rtx 4080 12gb after backlash huhdidnt see that coming sometimes complaining works i just wish it worked better on things that matter more than a gpu,0.6430000066757202,0.3100000023841858,0.04600000008940697
yes everything is a scam 40904080 are good but cost too much rtx 4080 12gb has same performancevram of a 3080ti and cost more rtx 4070 has same performancevram of a 3080 and cost more just get a 6900xt on discount or a used 3080ti for under £600 in any case wait for rdna3,0.7429999709129333,0.210999995470047,0.04600000008940697

what do you think the gpu formerly known as rtx 4080 12gb will be called when it is reannounced,0.029999999329447746,0.9279999732971191,0.041999999433755875
it also looks like rtx 4080 12gb wont be able to outperform rtx 3090 ti in benchmarks but it at least it is 1020 faster than original rtx 3080 are you kidding here its a 15 performance uplift over 3080 for a fake 4080 gpu gen to gen 15 at 200400 pathetic,0.7250000238418579,0.23399999737739563,0.04100000113248825

by cancelling the rtx 4080 12gb what nvidia has done in reality is kept the prices of new rtx 3090 higher for longer in the hopes people waiting for the 900 card will give up and buy a 3090 well see it come back as the 4070 ti but only once rtx 3090 stock is depleted,0.4909999966621399,0.47200000286102295,0.03700000047683716
the rtx 4080 12gb was too weak of an upgrade over ga102 rtx 3080 or else it wouldve been named plain rtx 4080 while the ad103 gpu got the ti or super moniker,0.421999990940094,0.5419999957084656,0.03700000047683716
i dont think they completely did there will be many rtx 4080 12gb cards from fe and aib so i think most reasonable story is rename and reconfig bios and release with new name if nvidia canceled completely it is likely to spread as lawsuit problem between nvidiapartner,0.296999990940094,0.6660000085830688,0.03700000047683716
i mean look at nvidia just unlaunching the rtx 4080 12gb im at the point where until i quite literally have the product at home and i am physically using it i have a small dose of skepticism,0.5210000276565552,0.4440000057220459,0.035999998450279236
the rtx 4080 12gb which should have been the rtx 4070 at 900 was going to be directly competing with the rtx 3090 which is still warming shelves at a price of you guessed it 900 that would have made the overstocked rtx 3090 unsellable nvidia is not your buddy,0.43299999833106995,0.5320000052452087,0.03500000014901161
the rtx 4080 12gb isnt being launched at least not under the name nvidia concedes that its a great card but the name is wrong and confusing having two models of the 4080,0.6169999837875366,0.3490000069141388,0.03400000184774399
#nvidia cancelled their rtx 4080 12gb honestly its for the best it really was just a 4070 but given the 80 tag to justify the high price i mean the thing preformed worse than the 4080 16gb and had less cuda cores theres no way this wasnt a 4070 originally,0.7360000014305115,0.23199999332427979,0.03200000151991844
the guess ive seen from others is the 070 has been priced as a mid tier gpu the rtx 2070 and rtx 3070 were priced at 499 for their respective launches the rtx 4080 12gb was nearly 2x that at 899 granted the rtx 4080 non 12gb is 1199 where as the rtx 3080 was 699,0.17499999701976776,0.7929999828338623,0.03200000151991844
rtx 4080 12gb is around 30 slower than rtx 4080 16gb never before the amount of memory has caused such big performance difference except the 12gb model also has a cut down 192 bit bus and has 2048 less cuda cores that explains it why not call this rtx 4070 instead,0.6359999775886536,0.33399999141693115,0.029999999329447746

nvidia is taking a step back unlaunching the rtx 4080 12gb the company had intended to release two rtx 4080 graphics cards next month the rtx 4080 12gb the rtx 4080 16gb with entirely different specs but it has now decided against releasing the lowerspec card,0.3009999990463257,0.6740000247955322,0.026000000536441803

note nvidia called the naming confusing without acknowledging that the rtx 4080 12gb would have used a different smaller chip than the rtx 4080 16gb that should have meant calling it an rtx 4070 but thats usually a 500 sku and would have never sold for 900 with that name,0.4390000104904175,0.5379999876022339,0.023000000044703484
pretty much everyone knows the rtx 4080 12gb is going to be hot garbage the only way that card sells is when it is thrown into prebuilts is just listed as rtx 4080 on the spec sheet its pretty much a 400 at best rtx 4060 ti it should be seen as such,0.7620000243186951,0.21699999272823334,0.020999999716877937

more i suspect sales of the rtx 4090 are not as rosy as nvidia would have you believe having all of the inventory fall into the hands of scalpers looks good on paper but not in practice a 900 rtx 4080 12gb would have killed 1200 4080 16gb sales now theres no other option,0.7400000095367432,0.24400000274181366,0.01600000075995922
nvidia cancelling the launch of the rtx 4080 12gb is right but honestly even the 4080 16gb and 4090 are very suspect it feels like the 4090 should have been a 4080 the 4080 16gb been a 4070 and the 4080 12gb should have never existed in the first place,0.7279999852180481,0.25600001215934753,0.014999999664723873

breaking news nvidia has been bullied into agreeing that the rtx 4080 12gb was dumb and shouldnt have been named that and the card is being pulled itll now be relaunched as the rtx 4090 12gb,0.7490000128746033,0.23899999260902405,0.010999999940395355

the 4080 is a scam i agree both the rtx 4080 are garbage the 4080 16gb is only 20 stronger than my rtx 3090 ti and the rtx 4080 12gb is an rtx 4070 scam that is weaker than my rtx 3090 ti,0.9120000004768372,0.07699999958276749,0.010999999940395355
do you think this could be nvidia screwing over aib partners on purpose to force them to leave like evga and xfx cancelling the rtx 4080 12gb would make a lot of aibs look like fools if they had plans to launch a 4080 12gb,0.7239999771118164,0.26600000262260437,0.009999999776482582
