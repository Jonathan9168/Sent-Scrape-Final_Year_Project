great 4090 comparison video each generation the founders edition card becomes more compelling my 3090 fe has ridiculous vram temps that prompted a repadding but it seems that nvidia solved that with the 3090ti and 4090 msi probably should prioritized it more on the suprim liquid x,0.04399999976158142,0.1809999942779541,0.7760000228881836

my guess is they released the 4090 first to get those sold out then the 4080s will come along with very similar performance although the 4090s will later perform even better with better cpu architecture but as was stated limited again by the port as always better is better but at a high price,0.02800000086426735,0.382999986410141,0.5889999866485596

i think a better video idea personally would be how the fe versions of the 4090 hold up against the base msrp versions from each manufacturer would be interesting to see how they all perform and itd put to bed the general belief that nvidia bins the best gpus for themselves,0.039000000804662704,0.6359999775886536,0.32499998807907104
looking at the results of the testing of the8auer it looks like you can decrease the power limit to 60 without losing any significant amount of power at all so therefore at least in normal gaming and rendering use the rtx 4090 can potentially be a 280350 watts card,0.017999999225139618,0.6650000214576721,0.31700000166893005
ok im confuse when nvidia launched the 3090ti for 2000 early this year pretty much everyone was excited now just a few months later nvidia launched the 4090 for 1500 wich for most reviewers is between 50 to twice faster than the 3090ti but now those that were excited and not impressed by a card that cost less at msrp and is almost twice powerful,0.14800000190734863,0.5590000152587891,0.2930000126361847

whats the quietest 4090 you have tested to date that maintains cooling similar or better to the 4090fe i like the 4090fe design that takes the heat out of the case but the 2 fan design gets noisy to keep temps in check,0.04699999839067459,0.6710000038146973,0.28200000524520874
i would love to see the numbers across the board for all variants of the 4090 cause so far all im seeing is that the fe is literally a better pick for the pricecost factor across the board while i understand both cards in this video did a tiny bit better its not worth the extra cost imo,0.3330000042915344,0.4259999990463257,0.2409999966621399

anybody running a 9900k with any of the 4090s at 4k what are your experiences thoughts,0.041999999433755875,0.9279999732971191,0.028999999165534973
i tried overclocking and getting at best top 10 i did for the 2070 super for awhile but for my 3080ti i got a bad card i cant even break 13000 these 4090 cards hitting 28000 to 30000 is crazy,0.777999997138977,0.19200000166893005,0.028999999165534973
they didnt put displayport 20 on the 4090 because they dont want these cards being used 5 years from now so youll have to buy the next gen gpu with the 20 port it would be like making a car that last for 30 years they want you to come back and buy another,0.5460000038146973,0.4269999861717224,0.02800000086426735
odd that nowadays people talk about the 500w and 600w draws of the 4090 card in passing whereas a few months ago when the card specs were announced they were screaming 500w and 600w like this sort of power draw for a graphics card was totally crazy and unacceptable,0.6539999842643738,0.3179999887943268,0.02800000086426735
i wanted to buy a 4090 fe directly at the start art 1210 but nvidia obviously had literally no fe card to sell at their own launchdate even if i would want to safe 400 bucks they didt have cards to sell because they sck,0.6269999742507935,0.34599998593330383,0.027000000700354576
what i would like to know iswhat is the memory junction temperature this has been a major issue with the rtx 30 series ,0.5559999942779541,0.421999990940094,0.023000000044703484
dont trust the pcie adapters probably need a new case and atx psu 30s arent dropping mainstream until january last i heard they dont have drivers for the 4090s hopefully they come out with one thats smaller than a ps5,0.6039999723434448,0.37299999594688416,0.02199999988079071
oh man evga always had better ram than asus and customer servicerma such a shame we wont see a evga 4090 we will probably see an evga intel card though,0.8690000176429749,0.10899999737739563,0.02199999988079071
that card barely counts as liquid cooled imo i really want to see a test with a proper water block i usually get one but my msi gaming trio 4090 runs so cool and quiet i dont know if its even worth it,0.8109999895095825,0.16899999976158142,0.020999999716877937
i wanted to buy aorus 4090 master but now i am not so sure is it a bad strix this gen or fe kills everyone,0.7229999899864197,0.25699999928474426,0.020999999716877937
i always liked the evga graphics card styling and none of these aib cards do anything for me if i were to choose a 4090 id buy the fe,0.8149999976158142,0.16599999368190765,0.019999999552965164
the 4080s are the beginning of the scam that will likely be the rest of the 4000 series lineup 4090 is fast and priced as expected,0.753000020980835,0.22699999809265137,0.019999999552965164
wasnt necesary for a card to be in the same range as other card to get similar power consumption if the 4090 consume 80 watts more wasnt more accurate to call it the 4095 or something ,0.44200000166893005,0.5370000004768372,0.019999999552965164
my rtx 2070 is always 80°c in nzxt h210 cant imagine using this card wew cant imagine how hot would it be if u use rtx 3090 ,0.8169999718666077,0.164000004529953,0.01899999938905239
the 4090 not having so 20 and pcie 5 is a stupid cop out cause you know just as damn well as i do that its either gonna be a stupid driver update for the dp 20 or they are literally saving those features for the 4090ti variant,0.8320000171661377,0.15000000596046448,0.017999999225139618
that system is a significant bottleneck considering this is ign and were using a 4090,0.6700000166893005,0.31299999356269836,0.017000000923871994
better to buy amd than the cheap boosting rtx4090 with dlss3 this is a disaster hope amd must use the advantage to dethrone nvedia in this gen,0.8700000047683716,0.11400000005960464,0.01600000075995922
this is not a fair test please use a 12th gen cpu at the least for even a rtx 3090 not the ti version the i99900k bottlenecks it 26 and can only run a 3090 at the max of 75 approx the i99900k would be a perfect match for a 3070 this test shouldve have a rig with a i912900k especially with a 4090,0.828000009059906,0.15700000524520874,0.014999999664723873
the chart at 758 seems typoed is amd really pulling a 10x on the 4090 with the 6950xt i suspect not especially with the extreme asymmetry of the fairly normal score in medical though i could very well be wrong,0.5619999766349792,0.421999990940094,0.014999999664723873
honestly id rather buy a 3090 for 800 if value of previous gen drops further more with partner releases the pricing of 4090 and 4080 seems just silly,0.7409999966621399,0.24400000274181366,0.014999999664723873
overclocking the 4090 should be illegal jay better read the fine print it might be illegal,0.6669999957084656,0.3179999887943268,0.014999999664723873
what might be an issue on a 4090 that causes 3dmark to freeze the whole computer at the end of a benchmark ive had it go through the entire benchmark process and force me to hard restart my pc at the point when 3dmark should be showing the scores,0.6970000267028809,0.289000004529953,0.013000000268220901
look the guy is so sad when talking about 4090 ,0.8519999980926514,0.13699999451637268,0.010999999940395355
aib has stopped binning chips from 30 series if you dont want to give them free money stop purchasing any oc model 4090s cooler design are all overkill thanks to nvidia not sharing correct power draw info with aibs you wont see any difference between 1599 base models and 1999 rog strix,0.8040000200271606,0.18400000035762787,0.010999999940395355
i think my blood pressure raised a bit when i reflected on the fact that he has three 4090s and tells us we shouldnt buy one thats overpriced like we would ever want to bro you guys horded them all,0.8309999704360962,0.1599999964237213,0.008999999612569809
why isnt anyone saying that gpuz cant read the transistor count for the 4090 it still says 10700 when it should be 76000 or so,0.703000009059906,0.2879999876022339,0.008999999612569809
