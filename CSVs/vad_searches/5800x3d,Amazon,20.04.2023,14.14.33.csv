was on the fence to upgrade my gpu 5700xt but a decent gpu is way too expensive right now so decided to upgrade my ryzen 3600 cpu to the 5800x3d for better performance glad i did my frame rates and performance increased significantly now i can wait until a couple years to upgrade and maybe gpu prices to get to decent levels great purchase,0.0,0.776,0.224,0.9528

what can i say this is a great processor for all games that tend not to be limited gpus therefore simulators rts mmos esports titles played in 1080p at very high frames things like that on iracing i literally doubled the frames by upgrading from a 3600x if you only play aaa or in 4k its not necessarily worth spending that much,0.025,0.779,0.196,0.886
even with the likes of the amd 7000s and inter 13th gen the 5800x3d is still among the best gaming cpus if you already have an am4 system it could be an awesome drop in upgrade there are many game reviews of the 5800x3d check to see how it works with the specific games you play first as not every game benefits from the extra cache,0.055,0.771,0.174,0.8811

it is very powerful compared to a ryzen 2700x in games with a 3070 it gets about 40 fps more and also when streaming it drops very few fps if you want to play stream and edit videos in 4k this is your processor if its just for editing or multicore tasks buy the normal 5800x and save yourself some money,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.8399
it has been the best upgrade i could have provided for my old ryzen 7 1700 machine and by adding another two sticks of ram to populate all of the available ram slots the full potential of this cpu has been unlocked even on something as old as an asus crosshair vi hero,0.0,0.863,0.137,0.8316
this thing is a beast it runs extremely hot even with a really good fan setup temperatures of 7080 are considered good for this chip at full throttle the extra cache is so good and this chip destroys my ryzen 7 3700x even at 30 cpu usage animal performance,0.063,0.722,0.214,0.8204
