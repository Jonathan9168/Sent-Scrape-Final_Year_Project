yeah but if you re an enthusiast or just want the best parts and have the money then the 5800x3d or 12900ks is what you ll go for i guess it s more for the highend consumer anyways imo a 12100f to 12600kf or 5600 to 5700x is really what ideal performance should be in a good gaming pc,0.0,0.7,0.3,0.9681
if you play wow and raid especially there s simply nothing better for handling addon bloat though i love how easy to cool my 12400 is in my htpc gaming rig and it does pretty darn well when i take it on the road to play elsewhere,0.064,0.556,0.381,0.9606
oh hell yeah waiting for raptor lake as well as x3d i am an amd fan but i really like what intel did with alder lake adapting biglittle and existing atom architecture to those p cores and making it all work love it i hope they get access to a good transistor node so they can compete with the power usage of apple and amd,0.036,0.677,0.286,0.9595
neat i googled  rog strix f470f bios update not working  and the solution here supports my view i sure am glad you never had a problem like this you god of motherboard flashing truly awe inspiring,0.044,0.477,0.48,0.9587
exactly its an amazing cpu but its dependent on the games you play i dont understand why people fall in love with products and have to promote it like theyre getting paid to do so,0.0,0.618,0.382,0.9581
i have the same build 5600x and 6700xt but honestly for the things i play it s just working really well and i can t imagine needing much more i also play at 1080p so that s a thing but it s pretty solid what did you pay for yours,0.029,0.617,0.354,0.9577
recently upgraded from ryzen 5 3600 with 1070ti to ryzen 7 5800x3d and 6700xt i m really happy but realizing i should ve maybe gone for a stronger card although i really can t complain build looks really nice though enjoy it how are the thermals on the cpu i went with an aio solution just to be on the safe side,0.052,0.646,0.302,0.9575
good news is you only feel the pain of purchase price when you buy it but the feels enjoyment high fps everytime i think ima go cheap 3090ti or amd but honestly the fact 4080s are just easy to get for a little bit more is kinda appealing easy to get is kinda a selling point now days after the last few years,0.029,0.723,0.248,0.9545
x3d has more cache which offers better performance in various situations including many but not all games there is talks of maybe more am4 x3d options and x3d options for am5 chips if youre really looking for the greatest value this is definitely something worth investigating further,0.0,0.715,0.285,0.9497
hey man if thats what you wanted and it makes you happy no need to justify it to anyone else congrats on getting out of the rat race and speculations on whats going to happen in the future and enjoy playing this holiday season and congratulations on the raise,0.035,0.668,0.297,0.9477
i get why they disabled overclocking but the benefit of curve optimizer is just undervolting wrong curve optimizer also accepts positive values which add voltage but i refuse to believe that amd wasnt able to restrict it only to negative values,0.176,0.41,0.414,0.9453
under volt that 5800x3d if you haven t already i had mine for 6 months and just undervolted it good gains better temps wish i did it earlier edit just read that you did indeed undervolt it enjoy good setup,0.0,0.638,0.362,0.9432
thats pretty interesting im curious whether the scaling up the line is from the additional cores do these games effectively use 24 cores or better bins allowing higher pcore frequency im guessing mostly frequency also a good demo that the headline power numbers for everything only matter for productivity tasks,0.0,0.7,0.3,0.9432
super clean love the amount of rgb on that looking awesome,0.0,0.32,0.68,0.9423
13600k may be slightly faster but lga1700 wont work with my existing cooler and the mobos are slightly more expensive its just more cost efficient to go 5800x3d right now im hoping bf changes that bc i would love to have the 13600k but only time will tell,0.0,0.764,0.236,0.9395
i love this cpu sure it runs warm but it s easy to cool because it is so efficient i have the same cooler but run it with no fans the two front intake and the single rear exhaust keep it under 68 while gaming prime95 will make it hit 90 but thankfully i use my computer for games not calculating prime numbers,0.073,0.652,0.275,0.9385
wow nice one undervolting is king for sure no downside other than the time it takes to make sure its stable did you run prime 95 on each core separately for a while or did you run that core cycler script on each core to make sure its fully stable try undervolting your 3060ti next although perhaps you have already a nice 2040w less and more fps,0.053,0.688,0.259,0.9382
imagine caring what a person does with their money how is the  not afford  relevant here as he bought a card lol add in the fact it seems like he doesn t care that he got a 4080 instead of a 90 and is happy with the purchase,0.0,0.712,0.288,0.9371
simple and clean will be a very nice upgrade for yourself and hopefully give you 10 more years of fun enjoy,0.0,0.496,0.504,0.9355
on architectures that are extremely sensitive to memory performance the correct thing to do is invest in better jedec standards theres a good reason that pretty much every oem or laptop ryzen 4000 or ryzen 5000 system comes with 3200mt cl22 jedec ddr4 amd clearly realized it would provide a significant performance boost so they made it happen,0.0,0.755,0.245,0.9349
im in this boat but as a person using a much older setup ryzen 1700x vega56 my game at 1080p is still strong i get 150 fps in warzone so im happy with it but i feel like i should grab some late stage combo deal on the am4s while they are cheap,0.0,0.774,0.226,0.9345
thats awesome thats a huge upgrade must feel great congrats,0.0,0.265,0.735,0.9313
30 you must be loosing boost clocks how come regular 5000 like my older 5600x either crashed or didnt boost past 3 ghz when going more than 15 20 so far on my 5800x3d im at 13 and so far so good going 1 increment every 3 gaming sessions lol,0.0,0.74,0.26,0.9296
lmfao same card and we both didnt use that shitty included bracket   what clocks you getting with oc im able to get a stable 30603150mhz with my cold air intake and max fans with 133 limit youre build looks very nice and clean a sharp contrast to mine i dig it,0.0,0.745,0.255,0.9285
if im building a new system i will not bet on a dead socket like in raptor lake am5 seems a better option for me and about gaming zen43d cache models will be better than what intel is offering although what amd have now is not bad,0.0,0.723,0.277,0.9273
i ve said it a lot but the 5600 for 99 and the 5700x for 150 are some of the best purchases i ve made in the pc space what awesome deals those were,0.0,0.717,0.283,0.9253
maybe my perspective is off but i feel like usually even halo products of succeeding generations in general had better priceperformance compared to the midrange of previous generations i definitely get that the market is weird right now but i dont think in general you see such a regression i could definitely be wrong though,0.092,0.635,0.273,0.9231
yeah awesome the past few years ive been building systems for friends and family and still running my crossfire hd7970 ge system i generally like to built a pc at the start of a console generation that sees me through to the next so the cost doesnt concern me as much as making sure the system lasts through 8 years of gaming,0.0,0.789,0.211,0.9217
yeah i didnt think his griping about the memory specs was fair when i watched it glad to see intel telling ltt to play fair haha,0.0,0.542,0.458,0.9217
my sister is still using my 2500k build to this day i knew that cpu was very good in terms of price to performance but i had no idea it was that good coupled with a 1660 super she can play absolutely anything she wants though its mostly a sims 4 machine at this point,0.045,0.718,0.237,0.9191
i second this screen its just amazing colours size 27 just the overall feel when you game at close to its refresh rate maximum amazing screen then you have vrr and all i can truly say i recommend it,0.0,0.711,0.289,0.9186
great build to be honest the planning researching and the anticipation was the best part of the build process,0.0,0.536,0.464,0.9186
i love it silent cool and looks great as long as you have positive pressure air flow you should have very minimal dust issues,0.064,0.523,0.413,0.9186
zen 4 is pretty decent much higher efficiency than 13th gen and came out earlier 3d v cache is just gives a huge boost to gaming wait for the 7000 series 3d v cache chip it will be impressive,0.0,0.682,0.318,0.9186
it s kickass for sure no complaints but i mainly run msfs at 4k and just barely maintain 60fps with subultra settings i d someday like to move up to 120hz and so will need more horsepower and frame generation to do it 70c is great that s a good cooler,0.061,0.686,0.253,0.9178
yeah someone would definitely ask about 5800x3d glad they added it themselves pretty nice build you got there that ram is planned for the 13th gen cpu upgrade right,0.0,0.633,0.367,0.9169
did an upgrade from 3700x to 5800x3d and holy shit was it worth it i play at ultrawide 1440p 144hz and every single thing is smoother i have a 3080 as well 1 lows have been boosted considerably easy 4050 fps gain in destiny 2 and general smoothness in everything else i play dont think ill get another cpu without the 3d cache works wonders in mmos,0.07,0.666,0.264,0.9157
who gets a 5950x today lol the 5900x is still a better value yeah i forget that different countries have different pricing here in australia the 5900 is bad value and the 5950 is surprisingly good value,0.109,0.484,0.407,0.9153
yeah youll be fine and at the end of the day its whatever performance you are happy with lol cant make cheeky comments on reddit without being down voted into oblivion enjoy the upgrade,0.0,0.679,0.321,0.9136
i would say the 68°c are more relevant than the fps here but i agree its a bit of an excessive reaction gifemotefreeemotespacksweatsmile but then again its free and fairly easy to do so why not gifemotefreeemotespackshrug,0.0,0.729,0.271,0.9109
it doesnt make the 3090ti a better price to performance than the 4080 12gb even though in that specific instance it is the best price to performance of my current options yes yes it does do you understand how priceperformance works go ahead buy a gpu at msrp do you also buy your cars at msrp,0.0,0.8,0.2,0.91
i just updated the bios to the latest official stable version for my mb agesa 1207 is the one that added support for the 5000 series i believe then i just swapped the cpus like normal worked perfectly straight away,0.0,0.703,0.297,0.91
haha i was thinking the same thing sitting here feeling pretty good about my purchase lol,0.0,0.427,0.573,0.9081
i bought a prebuilt but i am upgrading mobo and 5800x3d the prebuilt had 10700kf how do i go about undervolting amd please and help is greatly appreciated,0.0,0.648,0.352,0.9079
i have a 4090 and playing at the same res and was with a 3800x until i upgraded to a 5800x3d like you def helped with cpu bound titles and helped eliminate bottleneck wherever there was before d congrats and nice build oddly enough im rocking the same white rgb color scheme lol,0.0,0.759,0.241,0.9062
huge cache called edram that worked like an l3 cache i think it was an experiment by intel not a halo product but more of a tech preview it had some interesting properties that the 5800x3d is showing with its huge cache this idea isnt new the silicon techniques have finally caught on to make it feasible and it has some tangible real world benefits,0.0,0.811,0.189,0.9062
yep the 5800x3d dies are incredibly well binned mine does 30 as well and i havent tried negative voltage offset i assume they take them straight out of the epyc bin since its all about keeping power down instead of boosting as high as possible as it is with vanilla zen3,0.0,0.751,0.249,0.9059
same gpu and i went from a 3900x to a 5800x3d its worth it for sure youll benefit from the 5000 series improvements plus the 3d cache big boosts in world of warcraft if you play that,0.0,0.664,0.336,0.9042
i love getting cucked therefore this is the best system lol just take cucked 101 and then youll know,0.0,0.573,0.427,0.9042
its faster but not by much in most games and its 2x the price so once you get 60fps in the games you care its all good plus when talking games allot of them are parents getting it for their kids so they wont spend 2k when 1k is acceptable to the kid,0.0,0.818,0.182,0.9022
dang i knew air coolers can get big but to cover the whole motherboard is impressive great build,0.0,0.598,0.402,0.9022
also watch out for amd s army of neanderthal social media accounts on reddit forums and youtube they will be singing their own praises as usual wow actually wow,0.0,0.694,0.306,0.9001
wow man thanks for the report i might still try to snag one of these off of ebay to play with again thanks for the detailed report,0.0,0.647,0.353,0.9001
i mean to be fair to both parties these slides and proofs are probably prepared and rechecked many times well in advance not like they could ve turned all that around in a day sure they re all prepping new material now but it s better to wait for the third party reviewers anyway,0.026,0.715,0.259,0.9
it would be really good if you could amalgamate the performance of cpus and gpus like tpu does those guys do an amazing job also thank you for your tool,0.0,0.684,0.316,0.8999
diy is tiny part of overall market this is true but everyone knows this this is about diy sales not oem or mobile amazon newegg and mindfactory all show amd cpus occupying the majority of the top spots in the best selling lists and again we are talking diy desktop cpu sales,0.0,0.801,0.199,0.899
dont get your expectation up with the 7800x3d it may well be better but the caching solution may not give it any performance boost at all above the 5800x3d you may have to rely on the raster improvements some folks seem to think theyll get a massive jump in performance but that remains to be seen,0.0,0.794,0.206,0.899
thank you haha yeah i love the 4090 it s such a beast and able to brute force all my games i got this new case just because of the card,0.0,0.659,0.341,0.8979
wow i love this platform thanks,0.0,0.155,0.845,0.8979
3080 msrp was also better than the 4090 in terms of perf at this point im pretty sure the 4090 is for people who play in 8k or 4k240 because my 3080 handles 4k 120hz completely fine,0.0,0.713,0.287,0.8977
nice build and solid parts list pretty similar to mine though i was able to pickup a used 6900xt from hws for 550 a while back and love it,0.0,0.651,0.349,0.8957
ya i like ultrawide as well the nice thing about 8k is it captures every major resolution underneath it perfectly no more old games or emulators or apps having weird scaling behavior hopefully like 1440p doesnt fit into 4k cleanly for example,0.11,0.584,0.307,0.8954
i think that might be a tactic one generation xx90 is bad value but xx80 is good value next gen xx90 is a good value but xx80 is bad value rinse and repeat,0.147,0.461,0.392,0.8934
better more appealing products are the goal of capitalism indirectly yes for example with nvidia you are buying mindshare and with apple you are buying marketing the product you hold in your hand isnt what youre paying for however so to insinuate that the product itself is better is just delusional,0.0,0.801,0.199,0.8934
yeh i love how people are like  haha nvidia you fools i will just buy the most expensive card you have and teach you a lesson  like wow yeh you guys are so smart nvidia totally getting fucked by you savvy investors,0.135,0.531,0.334,0.8913
this hub guys cowered to the fanboys he needs to keep delivering red meat to the bulk of his viewers and keep them happy if it costs some honesty point hub is happy to make that sacrifice,0.0,0.762,0.238,0.891
jumping onto this is there a good version of what userbenchmark should be a website not a video with easy to read numbers from realworld benchmarks and its not full of ads and shit and it works well on mobile if i could trust the numbers userbenchmark would be awesome edit the best suggestion so far is,0.088,0.67,0.242,0.8908
nice thank you luckily i d been reading a bunch of other articlesreviews and stuff before i came across ubm i have a few lists in partpicker sans gpu cause i was waiting to see what went down with amd today so i ll definitely post to that sub and get some feedback,0.0,0.78,0.22,0.8905
is it not obvious intel is using all the power they can push through the cpu even resorting to golden sample with the ks series and amd responded in kind personally i wish amd just used the 105 watt eco mode as default as well but i understand why they did it this way benchmarks rule the day luckily its an easy set and forget fix,0.032,0.781,0.187,0.8898
wow thank you for this got a nice little boost,0.0,0.303,0.697,0.8887
it seems like a pretty good futureproof cpu so you can look at it as a long term investment even better if you get it on sale,0.0,0.646,0.354,0.8885
pretty similar to my path i went from a 1500x to a 5600x on the strix b350f was pretty excited when amd finally released zen 3 support to first gen ryzen boards,0.0,0.676,0.324,0.8885
you can get this info from hwinfo64 as well and it classifies each of them from best to least best,0.0,0.618,0.382,0.8885
that is so awesome am4 is the best,0.0,0.389,0.611,0.887
amd won t want to do it anyways the x3d cache is super expensive to add so they don t make much money on the 5800x3d they only did it to hold off 12th gen intel until their am5 parts were ready,0.0,0.759,0.241,0.886
5900x is really great value at around 349 200 less than the 50x ahhh its not that big a difference here in australia 5950 is surprisingly well priced,0.0,0.669,0.331,0.8852
i didnt know that weird how people downvoted you so much   in the us at least the 5950x doesnt seem to be target of any sales we got some amazing ones last cyber monday almost bought one like 1000aud for a 5950 on ebay with afterpay was an amazing deal at the time,0.0,0.805,0.195,0.8848
very much unlikely ltt is a network focused on entertainment not accuracy and after their ceos adventure with not understanding ethics and responsibility im even more doubtful that anything they produce can be taken at face value without cross verifying it with a more trustworthy source,0.049,0.695,0.256,0.8834
shouldnt matter that much iirc i think smaller one just pumped clocks too high you want pretty easy workloads later i did small set avx2 to fully stress the chip but usually once the easier workload was stable the avx2 one was as well,0.06,0.661,0.279,0.8825
lol wat cmon guys lets be honest here when you give an example of you upgrading the cpu to what is essentially a decade of technological improvement i mean what else is there but improvement what the other guy originally is saying is that a cpu that is only a couple years old would probably work just as fine for most people,0.0,0.812,0.188,0.882
i went from a 3700x to the 5800x when it came out and i know the 3d is even better then seriously worth the upgrade have mine on a 3070 founders and honestly its a great pairing though i may do a jump to the 3090 soon,0.035,0.72,0.245,0.8807
but then you can say that for pretty much every card the stat is there to help you answer the question on whether some performance goal is worth it to you,0.0,0.733,0.267,0.8807
awesome compilation of data thanks for that comparisons vs other cards and vs previous years specs is very useful tks,0.0,0.625,0.375,0.8805
the 5800x3d seems to have more success achieving 30 all core compared to thje nonx3d parts very different vf curve i guess as uislandoffew suggested use core cycler its the best tool for the job imo as it was created specifically for this purpose,0.0,0.797,0.203,0.8805
huh have you checked for any new bios all old am4 motherboards should have received support for 5000 series if not due to lousy support then its probably better to wait for the 7000 series and am5 release soon and build a new system,0.0,0.778,0.222,0.8793
i have 5600x and i love the fact that am4 still gives an opportunity for improvement im thinking about 5900x or 5800x3d too but currently i think 5600x is ideal cpu for what it cost,0.0,0.716,0.284,0.8779
no it isnt needed but it is recommended it technically is a small overclock with extra positives since the better thermals and voltage allows the cpu to run on average 150 mhz faster and almost 10 degrees celsius cooler i went from 14300 in cinebench r23 to 15000 after undervolting,0.028,0.782,0.189,0.8765
yeah the fan is positioned to the left it s best to reposition and make sure it s level,0.0,0.542,0.458,0.875
great review when it comes to fabric speeds i more interested on which cpu does rt better,0.0,0.565,0.435,0.8748
the bizarre way they weight results to disadvantage amd means they also make weird predictions like an i3 being faster than an i9 if youre confident that you wont get caught out by oddities like that then its still usable but there are still much better sources of benchmark results so i think its best to just avoid the site completely,0.104,0.686,0.21,0.8734
congrats i hold my systems for about ten years then i move my the guts from my desktop to the server and upgrade the desktop with new new to me parts the server runs open media vault so it can run on 20 year old hardware most of the games i play dont require major upgrades as often so i enjoy my hardware and the upgrades to the fullest,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.8725
yeah this is me ive never purchased the top tier but the 4090 makes me want to change that and i will need to get a bigger case and psu just to make this switch but it seems like a card i can happily use for at least 5 years,0.025,0.762,0.213,0.8721
welp the results are in the 5800x3d is still basically as good as the new cpus lol so its still one of the best upgrades you can do right now,0.0,0.732,0.268,0.872
being this mad over how someone else spends their money is peak redditor lmao the same group that spergs out with silly stuff like cost per frame charts should probably try to account for the value of just having the best performance on the market for 225 years,0.054,0.708,0.238,0.872
except hes right it is true check hardware unboxed and the 13900k review total platform cost per frame the 5800x3d is the best insanely good cpu given it can only use ddr4 2513,0.0,0.752,0.248,0.872
fair but i think it is worth bringing up the inherent deals that can be found with previous generation cards you shouldnt change the priceperformance charts for these deals but bringing up its possible to increase that ratio is good,0.0,0.764,0.236,0.8689
honestly cant wait for 7000x3d to release so i can get in on the next gen of this amd goodness being able to swap in a crazy fast new processor a few years down the line is amazing value,0.053,0.68,0.268,0.8689
ha thats exactly the rig i have and upgrade i plan to do glad to see it was so successful,0.058,0.543,0.398,0.8679
its not the cores but all the extra cache the 5800x3d brings that makes the difference the ipc improvements will make the 5600x a decent upgrade from zen 2 but the 5800x3d is the best gaming cpu in the range rn,0.0,0.809,0.191,0.8674
sure there is some and there could have been significantly better ppw improvement and there is if you manually underpower the 4090 its out of the box wattage is so wildly far from its optimal frameswatt setting on the power curve,0.0,0.776,0.224,0.8658
wow thanks for the heads up just checked and theres a new bios for my board f37a 20230208 1 checksum b400 2 update amd agesa v2 1208 3 optimized performance for 5800x3d,0.0,0.72,0.28,0.8658
i think 5600g makes sense building a zen 3 pc now is going to be cheaper than a while ago and going for 8c or more is easier to justify if you are going for 6c its probably for a good enough kind of build which more often than not are systems that do not need a dgpu the 5600g is perfect for those,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.8651
depends on what game or task you play i dont see any problem with drop in temp for same performance is a problem you get the benefit of less fan noise less of a heater in your room less power consume overall etc theres more benefit of dropping the temp for the same performance than not having a higher temp no,0.063,0.718,0.219,0.8632
i have an average micron e die ram kit that barely costs anything above the best selling ripjaws crap dies my 5600g just has pbo enabled kinda like intel can have good ram and be on a great cooler to use turbo boost max to achieve its peak performance for proper comparisons,0.101,0.65,0.249,0.8627
good to know thx for sharing i also own 3900x 3070 ram 32gb 3600 cl16 and i play mainly csgo at 1080p so probably if i ever decide to upgrade i will go with 5800x3d i bought 3900x 2 years ago for 408 i see that now in local stores new 5800x3d costs 480 i can do it even cheaper if i go for a used 5800x3d,0.0,0.833,0.167,0.8625

if your board has the x570 or b550 chipset youre good and would simply need a bios update at most other chipsets like x470 or b440 or older check your manufacturers website to ensure compatibility but theres a high chance you just need a bios update as well,0.0,0.788,0.212,0.8308

that makes total sense but i know which one i would choose if the options were to use high performance power plan or ease up the offset a few steps then again i guess you would have to be really unlucky indeed to not be stable at 30 was pretty much a guarantee with the early batches at least,0.037,0.802,0.161,0.828

now that the 7900 xt and xtx have been released for 900 and 1000 respectively and very likely provide greater performance than the 3090 ti nvidia will have to bring prices of the 3000 series down in order to compete with luck the 3000 series prices weve been waiting for will go down as far as we have been wanting,0.0,0.875,0.125,0.8

intel need to decide who theyre marketing this towards theyre using gaming but its a 16 core productivity cpu that happens to be good at gaming like the 5950x in that case why mention the 5800x3d if the focus is gaming the obvious point is that the 8 core gaming cpu is obviously much cheaper so why not use a comparable i7,0.0,0.889,0.111,0.7964

if you have a good mb highend gpu and psu go for the 5800x3d and keep your mbram if your mb is just okay and midranged gpu the 5700x is probably a better upgrade only go for the 7950x if you want to build a whole new pc all new parts wont be able to upgrade to this one as its am5,0.0,0.859,0.141,0.7906

if you play star citizen you can go from something silly like 40 fps to 120 fps that game just loves cache for some reason probably very unoptimized heh,0.053,0.675,0.273,0.7796
sounds about right for the 5000 series i can push my regular 5800x to fclk 2000 but its not 100 stable 1900 its rock solid though once my x3d shows up in a couple weeks itll be interesting to see how it handles fclk clocks hopefully ill get a good chip,0.099,0.69,0.211,0.7794

5800x3d was the best i could go on the am4 i had a 3600 before and so it was a huge upgrade in fps i game in 3440x1440 and 3820x3820 anyway so i m more gpu bound,0.0,0.805,0.195,0.7759

you may want to look again pretty sure the amd keynote said no such thing and i watched it here s proof the 7600x has an msrp of 299 good right and it is good except the 5600x is 213 on newegg right now yeah for a new system build if you aren t on a tight budget it s still better to go with the new zen 4 on am5 but cheaper it isn t,0.022,0.811,0.167,0.775
currently on a 3900x with a 3080 really considering a 5800x3d do you feel like the 1 and 01 lows improved mainly trying to improve frame stability,0.061,0.648,0.29,0.7717
let me know your future plan because i am in the same boat was looking into upgrade options for the am4 base and it seems that the extra cache from the 5800x3d seems to net positive effects performance wise which gpu are you using 5700xt for me,0.0,0.868,0.132,0.7717

you wont really notice fps above your monitors refresh rate is such an annoying yet persistent myth at 149 for explanation of course if you have a 240hz monitor its less noticeable but its definitely beneficial if you have 60 and probably if you have 140,0.036,0.82,0.144,0.7615

lmao that doesnt mean amd doesnt have headaches because of it this is clear from amd omitting the 5800x3d from their charts for zen4,0.0,0.772,0.228,0.7579
even then itll probably be really competitive until higher bandwidth ddr5 kits drop a lot of 3600mhz ddr4 kits are pretty cheap and ideal for the x3d,0.064,0.673,0.263,0.7574

not wrong didnt say you couldnt use it for positive values but the main benefit in terms of performance which is the context here is negative values undervolting,0.125,0.543,0.333,0.7526
a comprehensive rt benchmark is really hard to come by how cpu speed dependent is it does it scale across cores how well does it scale is it bandwidth dependant does intel do a better job than amd the truth is that there are no comprehensive rt benchmarks so people default to rhe 3080 and a ddr4 cpu,0.062,0.76,0.179,0.7512

i bought one today after it going to about 370 euro launch was 500 im on a 3700x with an x570 motherboard that i bought 3 years ago this should last me some time as well what i especially caved for is the extra fps in more strategy games like factorio and satisfactory,0.0,0.859,0.141,0.7479
i wondered the same 8c16t with double or triple the cache it obviously makes a difference so how hard can it be to make a 13750k or something like that targeting gamers i won t be upgrading until next fall probably but hopefully by then i ll know if i m going back to intel or doing a 787900x3d build,0.024,0.839,0.137,0.7439
yeah im on a 5800x and honestly i could probably go back to the 3600x and not notice a difference i game at 1440p with a 3080 im not really missing another 50fps in csgo,0.0,0.787,0.213,0.7434
thing is its not pure the x3d people coming from 3000 series forgot that the 5000 series offered already a massive 10 to 30 performance gain because of the ccx merging it makes the x3d look better because youre technically doing a double generation jump,0.0,0.867,0.133,0.743
since you mentioned eu4 do you ever use the meiou and taxes mod i love the idea behind it but could never get over the slow speed on my system now that even beyond typus is running slow on my 3700x i m thinking of upgrading ideally to something that can handle mt the 5800x3d is high on my list so i don t have to replace a bunch of other parts,0.0,0.91,0.09,0.743
what do you mean with well also have a 3080 and i would never do 4k with it because in most modern games the gameplay feels at 60fp currently the best setup for me is 1440p at 120 fps imo,0.0,0.851,0.149,0.743

dont mind these lame commenters that is a very sweet build and you will be able to run everything up to 4k if you really want to,0.0,0.761,0.239,0.7366
if you are just gaming 5800x3d if you are ever rendering or anything like that5800x i think the 5700g has a graphics chip in it not an expert honestly but id go for the others update your bios before you change make sure the 370 supports 5 series,0.034,0.809,0.157,0.7359

i went from i7 7700k to r9 5950x sadly i also changed my monitor to samsung galaxy g9 so my preformance plumeted lol had to then upgrade everything else rog strix 3090 gave me a huge bump from 2080 super,0.062,0.737,0.201,0.7351
i feel that but i went with affirm   sitting on like 650 of debt rn   but its all good ill be back to upgrading soon im happy with what i have right now especially when the 3060ti gets here,0.139,0.619,0.243,0.7351
i mean im one of them a nice upgrade to my 3800x it was supposed to be a consolation for not getting a threadripper 5000 series but then the low core count ones popped up for sale like 2 weeks after i bought the 5800x3d well at least its still an amazing cpu even if im now poor,0.103,0.699,0.198,0.7351
great combo wickedly fast i love it too,0.201,0.26,0.539,0.7351

50 better gaming performance and 2x raw cpu performance pretty massive upgrade for a relatively inexpensive price,0.0,0.697,0.303,0.7269
i had no idea about there being a b450e just checked it out and you are correct perhaps a rare find at the time of getting my b450f or it wasnt announced as yet it definitely has better vrms could definitely run a 5950x perhaps,0.046,0.779,0.175,0.7269
lots of amd users also just buy the 5800x3d right now as it still fits on am4 boards and does work well with slower ram getting a huge performance boost by just replacing the cpu is a nobrainer especially since ddr5 ram and the new mainboards are still quite expensive,0.0,0.864,0.136,0.7269
13900k is better which it obviously should be being the price difference but 5800x3d is an insane value if youre still on the amd platform granted their are multiple factors at play depending on ddr5 speeds and such also props to intel for even including it amd didnt so theres that,0.059,0.764,0.177,0.7269
hi guys i am building new pc now and want to ask something that i didnt understand the 13700k got tdp of 125w and turbo of 253wz that means that he will use all the time 253w because everyone of us got the cpu turbo while entering a game or something else ive got corsair rm750x and hope that it can have it thanks,0.0,0.891,0.109,0.7269
yes but x3d spanks 12th gen up to the 900ks so its still better for gaming,0.0,0.697,0.303,0.7266

the really big win with the 5800x3d in eft is in offline raids where the additional load of handling the ai is on the cpu that also goes for things like sptaki i upgraded from a 3900x to a 5800x3d back in april for eftspt and it made a massive difference,0.029,0.845,0.126,0.7251
because he said when it dies on himso im assuming he has the money but just hes okay with it performance reality is even a 5600 would be a huge jump and not really that costly for board and memory,0.0,0.832,0.168,0.723
i went from 3600x to 5800x3d with 5700xt graphics card id say a moderate step up not quite what i really wanted for 360 but im still happy with the purchase,0.0,0.842,0.158,0.7227

its so good it hurts both intel and amd in the high end pair it with cheap mobos memory and cooling the 5800x3d is the best buy imo right now only thing stopping me from getting the x3d is im not in that ecosystem either am5 gives a better long term path even with the pretty nasty cost of entry currently its not that much more i guess,0.106,0.728,0.166,0.7122
yeah im kinda in the same boat have a 3600 and wondering if the upgrade to a 5600x would keep me happy for time to come on my budget b450 board,0.0,0.821,0.179,0.7096
its just a different naming scheme at least it will be easier to decipher which gen chip youre getting where in the past you were getting rebrands anyway on lower tier chips but there was no clear way to tell this is actually an improvement,0.083,0.74,0.176,0.7096

yes of course i play mainly pubg and mw2 at 1440p 165hz max settings and i d like to get better 01 and 1 lows i hate when fps goes below 120fps i think my processor has a lot to do with low fps in intense scenes 5600x with what i ve seen with better cpus and gpus i wouldnt come across this problem with better hardware,0.142,0.624,0.234,0.7073
let s not forget they aren t even running the amd chips with their best config they are using 3200mhz ddr4 and not the preferred 3600mhz,0.0,0.789,0.211,0.7065
they don t really they normally go for around 300€ so it seems they kinda do and they are not really available and definitely not with such tight timings a 32 gb ddr56400c32 kit can be had for 266 eur most people would probably be better off spending a similar amount on fast ddr5 rather than fast ddr4,0.0,0.9,0.1,0.7063

thatll be the long term goal run my 3700x and 3070 until the whole kit needs a refresh my 3700x does not overclock well unfortunately i can get 100 mhz out of it but the temps dont justify the tiny performance gain,0.032,0.831,0.137,0.6918

i kept my old cooler it s a cryorig c1 rated for 140w tdp i was unsure about how it would perform but it seems good enough for the time being the cpu did thermal throttle when doing a burn 100 stress test but since undervolting the cpu by 30 it hasn t throttled since happy enough with that for now,0.08,0.783,0.137,0.6908

yes i also know of the long route which is why i settled on 15 but op says he can adjust each cores individually for even better results,0.0,0.808,0.192,0.6908
not even amd included 5800x3d in their marketing slides its just too good lol,0.0,0.678,0.322,0.6908
the ltt video and wiki are probably the two most easily approachable things about it haha,0.0,0.711,0.289,0.6901
they probably like having more than 10 profit margin,0.0,0.553,0.447,0.6872
they are better but the results are still very misleading on the cpu front i think they only count cores after the 4th one for 2 of the total score so it will make modern i3s and 7th gen and earlier score way better than they really should applications that need more than 4 cores to get good performance are fairly common these days,0.056,0.807,0.137,0.6869
im one of those am4 users eventually my 2600x will be retired and i fully intend to get a 5800x3d to extend the rigs lifespan for a few more years i dont need the extra cores on this box to warrant a 5900x 5950x and i have a feeling that 3d cache will start becoming more and more useful as this console generation matures,0.0,0.89,0.11,0.6865
5800x vs 2700x is roughly 50 increase the 5800x3d will be around the same but excell in specific applications of games that can benefit from the extra cache,0.0,0.821,0.179,0.6858

what is your primary use case that you werent too impressed with the difference between an fx 6300 and a 3600 thats gotta be like a 3050 upgrade in most situations i went from an i5 2500k to a 3600 and felt like i was quite satisfied with the upgrade,0.049,0.794,0.157,0.6746

at a certain point this needs to be irrelevant for the consumer the end product is what matters if it helps i wasnt saying that to excuse amd just stating it more as a matter of fact,0.0,0.774,0.226,0.6682
that may be why youre here but i wouldnt say its why we are here there are a ton of people here to talk about hardware in a broader sense when i hear where the market is heading in general i dont think diy even limiting the inquiry to the diy market i believe mindfactory has a significant skew towards team red and towards enthusiast parts,0.0,0.913,0.087,0.6652

if you are already in am4 then yeah get a 5800x3d for gaming but if you are building a new system 13600k is a much better proposition thats what i said,0.0,0.821,0.179,0.6652
one of the really big problems having conversations about priceperformance or relative value of the 40 series is that where you are in the world swings those things around a lot a strong dollar compared to the last several years and things like vat automatically being added on make big differences for what is or isnt considered ok to certain people,0.071,0.778,0.151,0.6634
yes at 1080p the gpu is faster than the instruction from cpu cpu upgrade will boost 1080 performance,0.0,0.748,0.252,0.6597

just so you and everyone else knows this isnt a thing it may be a freak occurrence but it is certainly not how it normally works op dont be posting sweeping statements like this when you have exactly one data point,0.044,0.813,0.143,0.6597
isnt it obvious big benchmark numbers are better for marketing and most people dont even think about efficiency,0.0,0.748,0.252,0.6597
looks good which mbram can you recommend,0.0,0.481,0.519,0.6597
surely the difference in temperature and clock speed shown here is because on the left the cpu is under 42 load and on the right its only under 36 load looks like too much varience in your testing methodology what results do you see in a more repeatable test,0.0,0.895,0.105,0.6597
well true but amd just didn t mention the x3d at all and i say this as an amd fan,0.0,0.701,0.299,0.6597
yeah i thought so thanks,0.0,0.271,0.729,0.659
that case is really cool like both ways,0.0,0.528,0.472,0.6566
its complete overkill but i kinda like the cool and quiet performance while still pulling 300w,0.0,0.708,0.292,0.6559
this case has been multiple times by people who are qualified to do so if you want to live under this rock go ahead there is a huge difference in 60 fps vs 200 for game like csgo valorant,0.0,0.846,0.154,0.6557
is that the problem i have to reinstall it pretty much every time i want to use it which is never at this point really gives me confidence in their other products,0.073,0.707,0.219,0.6557

after i saw perf from 13 series and ryzen 7 series immediately purchased a 5800x3d i m upgrading from 7700k but the availability of ram cost for mobos and power supply requirement aloud me to save enough money to pick up a 4090 and still leverage my older components this is def the 1080ti moment for amd,0.0,0.921,0.079,0.6486
depends on the games you play anything frequently cpulimited will probably benefit from the x3d whether its because of the type of game it is factory games tycoon games flight sims or because its badly cpu optimized tarkov arma 3,0.067,0.753,0.181,0.6486

i gotta reference this some say in germany you can get a cheap 4090 from gainward for 1950 but if you re splurging that much mula i want something good looking and that gainward is usually out of stock too,0.0,0.868,0.132,0.6486

same here about to upgrade from a 6 year old i76700k amd is getting my dollar over intel because it looks like it might be feasible to get a massive upgrade in 3 years with only a cpu and gpu swap instead of the entire system hoping i can then ride that upgrade for another 5 years or so,0.0,0.904,0.096,0.6486

am5 is a whole new platform so what s predictable not guaranteed is that it will have some bugs to work through initially but will end up very good 13th gen intel is not really a new platform more of an evolution on 12th gen so what s predictable not guaranteed is fewer bugs at launch,0.0,0.922,0.078,0.6474

upgraded my 3700x to the x3d it still blew my mind gaining nearly 50 fps in many games i played,0.0,0.766,0.234,0.6369
these new cpu reviews were almost a showcase of how strong the 5800x3d was which made people start to speculated how good a 7800x3d will perform and also that it can t be too far away this is the number one reason companies don t tease future products especially as a market leader it just stifles current gen sales,0.038,0.836,0.125,0.6369
im not a big per frame fan either if a card only got 40fps at 1080p but cost 50 its still useless for what i want even if it has the best frame in history,0.091,0.69,0.219,0.6369

your comment aligns perfectly from what ive heard from multiple other users except you were more polite about it x,0.0,0.811,0.189,0.6369
the only setting i have changed from default is the cycle time i do 1 minute per core and then it switches to the next definitely looks like your issue is with core cycler itself and not your system i would try deleting your current veresion of core cycler completely and just start over by redownloading the latest version and try again,0.0,0.915,0.085,0.6369

that was part of my thinking i wanted qhd 240hz rather than 4k 120hz and the 4090 is definitely bottlenecked at qhd went with a 4080 which is still kinda bottlenecked but not as badly thats why i asked if the 4090 was cpu bottlenecked at wideqhd,0.0,0.89,0.11,0.6347
fucking kids lmao,0.0,0.324,0.676,0.6344
5900x aint bad for 4k gaming but the 5800x3d could be slightly faster at 4k if you have a beefy gpu recommend waiting for the 7800x3d but it will cost you more money cause u will need a new board and ddr5 ram,0.0,0.88,0.12,0.634
thats some serious commitment works 3 seasons of the year not bad,0.088,0.542,0.369,0.631
yep core cycler is the way to go mine 5800x was passing all benchmarks and games at 30 all cores undervolt but it was crashing at idle if i left pc turned on it would wake me up in the middle of the night when fans roared at 100 during reboot with a lot of testing i ended with various values between 1 and 28,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.631
and thats why good reviewers dont care about is it a good value right now but about here is what this product is compared to other stuff out there so you can make a decision if it is worth it to you,0.041,0.782,0.178,0.6293
im just agreeing and feeling like it should be a bigger deal like the performance gains are incredible but i couldnt fathom the outrageous cost to me 999 is a ridiculous price point but for 1699 thats just bonkers,0.075,0.665,0.261,0.6273

thats weird so you got to an older bios no turbo but same performance have you tried a cpu only benchmark between the two and at the end of the day these cpus will run hot due to cache being stacked on top of the miniscule cores stay below 90 and youre good to go,0.05,0.847,0.103,0.6249

im on 3080 and ryzen 7 3700x so cpu is the deal now at least not with those gpu prices will probs just stick 5950x and call it a day until rtx 5000 will probably be sweet spot by that time well have proper ddr5 adoption on both intel and amd,0.0,0.902,0.098,0.6249
ok good i thought for a second there i thought meant a std or that linus had a std,0.0,0.702,0.298,0.6249
yea its why i think the gameonly narrative of the x3d is a bit overblown its still a great production cpu in a lot of use cases,0.0,0.843,0.157,0.6249
so far so good cpu gpu furmark only draws 560w from the wall its typically at 400w when gaming,0.0,0.816,0.184,0.6213
lol its not userbenchmark s fault that basically 99 of systems tested with their site are nvidia intel,0.0,0.748,0.252,0.6197
i run 30 on all cores it s been amazingly stable and cool,0.0,0.64,0.36,0.6195
id say yes love flight sim but that was the only game that i was struggling with the others that i played seemed fine,0.122,0.558,0.32,0.6187
i was having trouble running my memory at 3200 on my 1600x but since upgrading to the 5800x3d i can now run it happily at 3200 just my personal experience,0.056,0.794,0.15,0.6187
its so good it hurts both intel and amd in the high end pair it with cheap mobos memory and cooling the 5800x3d is the best buy imo right now,0.089,0.715,0.196,0.6161
i just tried warhammer 40k darktide and i would get 4060fps without dlss on highmedium setting and 100120fps with dlss performance so it seems like dlss is carrying the 30series card and im so sad that theyre locking the new one behind the 40series cards since it was so great on the 30series,0.067,0.8,0.133,0.6141
are they any good for intel vs intel or amd vs amd or nvidia vs nvidia comparisons or is that skewed as well,0.0,0.808,0.192,0.6124
yes ram can make a 20 difference in some games thats why im asking if hes using slow ram that would increase the performance difference between the 3900x and 5800x3d the 65 performance difference in valorant does seem quite big which made me think he probably has slow ram,0.0,0.902,0.098,0.6124
the other things are more or less the same but i understand your point i definitely wont upgrade to am5 anytime soon so a 5800x is the logical next step once i want to upgrade my system,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.6124
check if the version of your update was updated specifically to support this cpu i made it a point to check the release notes for my bios version prior to upgrade then checked the bios version that supported the 5800x3d the release notes will show this specially and then installed the latest version after that point,0.0,0.912,0.088,0.6124
thanks worked well enough for me,0.0,0.444,0.556,0.6124
info about used driver versions here but i see just a 10 performance improvement for rtx30 gpus when i compare reviews with new driver vs reviews with old driver,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.6124
amazing roundup thanks man what is most apparent is that if you are a gamer with an am4s socket then you do not need to upgrade to zen4 you just need to buy a 58003dx because overall it is at least as fast or within a margin of error as any other gaming cpu overall,0.046,0.839,0.115,0.6124
didnt that upgrade involve a mb upgrade too with a faster pci express port could it be that its not the cpu itself but faster gpu port standard that did the improvement,0.0,0.879,0.121,0.6124
i mean the point is to make it more cpu bound to know what scaling will look like over time dlss on current gen is kind of like native on next gen also the vast majority of people turning on rt are probably using some type of upscaling to reduce gpu load,0.0,0.907,0.093,0.6124

i had that case for a while no fans at all was pretty neat,0.126,0.517,0.356,0.6124
would be better yes but its still fine though,0.0,0.5,0.5,0.6124
phenomenal it s literally like 2x the performance in some games like cities skylines ffxiv factorio etc,0.0,0.737,0.263,0.6124
in real world performance there isnt really a difference but the tangible benefit is the temperatures and just seeing consistently higher clocks,0.0,0.833,0.167,0.6124
nice yeah this feature does not exist on gigabyte aorus elite when an x3d is plugged in it does otherwise,0.0,0.783,0.217,0.6124
something like corecycler will test per core co settings if you want to really dial in your settings while still being stable,0.0,0.76,0.24,0.6124
yeah as someone with shithot memory its definitely annoying have a late stepping 5700g in one of the office builds that does 2200fclk though so ive ocd a set of 3200mhz cl16 to 4400mhz cl17 in order to get my fast memory fix lol,0.056,0.785,0.159,0.6124
wow a benchmark that actually includes bannerlord one of the most thread count heavy games right now question is did they max out the battle size to 1000 because that is the true cpu test of bannerlord,0.062,0.782,0.156,0.6124

if you wanted to test set a 400mhz as the max single core of a 5800x3d is 45ghz vs 49 of the 5950x for single core the odd thing i think might stabilize the 5800x3d is it doesnt have a high single core boost like other ryzen chips so it stays stable at low load with single core,0.072,0.802,0.126,0.5046

unless you plan on getting a 40804090 youre probably not going to need to upgrade that cpu for at least 34 more years the 5600 is still perfectly capable i dont see the 5800x3d being any more in demand in the future than it is now its demand should drop once zen4 3d is revealed,0.094,0.794,0.112,0.4842
the 3090 was regarded as a ripoff when it was announced that depends on your usecase if you were just gaming then it wasnt worth it if you were doing something that actually used the 24gb of gddr6x ai 3d modeling etc then it was a godsend now we have the 4090 which provides over double the performance in blender,0.027,0.911,0.062,0.4826

tbf i am waiting for amd they dont even need to compete with the 4090 let it reign as the halo product if the radeon 7900xt can compete with or even out perform the 4080 at a slightly lower price point id call that an absolute win,0.039,0.883,0.078,0.4391
i have a feeling you dont understand computers very well,0.0,0.606,0.394,0.4391
the 5800x3d is much faster than the nonx3d ryzen cpus in almost every game it s not this 5050 thing where  it depends on the game  like you suggest as for gaming power even the 12700k is on par with the 5800x3d when using ddr5 memory to overtake the 5800x3d you definitely wouldnt need a 13900k lol,0.039,0.873,0.087,0.4344
oh it still kicks out heaps of heat if im tilting the tits out of it so thats always a bonus   its just so tempting to upgrade,0.064,0.809,0.127,0.4336
i upgraded yesterday 2700x 5800x3d results in cyberpunk rt ultra 720p dlss balanced to eliminate gpu bottleneck 2700x avg 69 min 36 max 90 5800x3d avg 128 min 62 max 174 same motherboard same memory same core count twice as much performance not bad,0.0,0.936,0.064,0.431
not so if youre building a new rig on a budget going with 13th gen intel is slightly better if you want to build on a dead platform if youre willing to spend a bit more then absolutely the best path is am5 7600x now but youll eventually wind up with a 9600x or even a 9600x3d and be competitive with probably intel 15th gen,0.06,0.82,0.12,0.4296
never said anything about the 13600k which looks to be the new value champion also no zen4 doesnt boost higher also its advertised at the stable clocks so no it doesnt throttle,0.162,0.632,0.207,0.4295
whether gaming is important or not flip flops every month,0.0,0.676,0.324,0.4284
its a good card honestly but that price is beyond good and evil this is a 2000€ gpu you will have this performance in a year for probably half that price or even less the hilarious part is that it is still a paper launch barely any cards available in germany as of right now,0.097,0.73,0.173,0.4277
with lower temps it can boost to higher clocks as it doesnt reach the thermal limit as fast thus giving higher fps,0.124,0.682,0.193,0.4265
7800x3d is going to require ddr5 and am5 thats the whole reason 5800x3d is so attractive but you could be right waiting for the 7800x3d for the 5800x3d drop in price might be the play,0.066,0.798,0.136,0.4254

i don t understand how it s a flex buy 4k120hz tv s aren t out of the average consumers reach and the gains over the 3090ti are absolutely real it s not like upgrading from the 3090 to the 3090 ti for single digit performance gains,0.048,0.818,0.134,0.4195
i understand now so something like microsoft flight simulator can dray something close to 100w and my cooler can handle ith100i capellix,0.0,0.878,0.122,0.4173
where all i see is either ddr5 4800 or ddr4 3200 both of which are within spec edit this didnt take long for him to delete his comment nothing beats lying and disappearing after getting called out,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.4168

nah the 1600x didn t come with a cooler however i did keep my old cooler which is a cryorig c1 it s not ideal but it s good enough for now with an undervolt on the cpu,0.086,0.807,0.107,0.4141
im pretty sure i make it a habit to updateinstall often but im going to double check myself after work,0.0,0.81,0.19,0.4118
probably not the additional performance is only in some games and is biggest at lower resolutions if you play at 1080p maybe if you have or plan to get a 4090 maybe but the 5600x should hold up well in gaming for quite some time,0.034,0.873,0.093,0.4118
love how amd is so upgradable not only do they put out processors with some good ass futureproofing but when you want to upgrade to a processor 5 gens later you just can i got a ryzen 7 3800x so im not upgrading for a while but i know that somewhere out there is a ryzen 9 thatll just plug into this system and work,0.037,0.863,0.1,0.4118

another 1 i went from a 3950x to a 5800x3d and i m seeing around a 30 fps boost in cod warzone going to use the 3950x for a homelab build instead,0.0,0.895,0.105,0.4019
just wait until you get your hands on the new custom bios being tossed around to unlock the cpu to overclock the 5800x3d will be able to get even more frames when we can boost it to 5ghz on all cores,0.0,0.937,0.063,0.4019
high resolution more pixels to calculate values for less fps if my math is correct for warzone he had 130ishfps before the upgrade and now he has 160ish,0.0,0.909,0.091,0.4019
definitely worth it on a 3070 alot of games are cpu heavy and this chip tears apart anything thrown at it,0.081,0.723,0.196,0.4019
have no idea 1080ti probably bears my super up right otherwise its probably my 3800 going to upgrade to 5900x3d,0.091,0.747,0.162,0.4019

in 3 years if you can find one for cheap it might be so again im just saying its less dead end and already better than the best am4 at multi threading even with a 13600k the comment im responding to was suggesting buying cheaper am4 products then buying a 5950x in a few years which is definitely a worse move,0.105,0.751,0.144,0.4005
200 cheaper its either the 6900xt is 66 cheaper or the 4090 is 200 more expensive well or if you want to hammer the point in it costs a third of the 4090,0.0,0.891,0.109,0.3976
no 3200 cl16 is fine the 5800x3d doesnt care much about the ram 3200 cl16 isnt slow its average i am surprised the 5800x3d was that big of a performance improvement in valorant despite the 3900x using fine ram,0.109,0.699,0.192,0.3964
it does i had a 5800x since launch and i spent alot of time getting the perfect co undervolt to where i never had any crasheswhea errors for 6months the 3d was a set it and forget it been 5 months not one crash,0.097,0.768,0.135,0.3935

yes you need to get to gpu bottleneck to take the gpu out of the equation which makes my example even stronger as that was the point difference in testing methodology between two products but claiming the result are comparable,0.0,0.912,0.088,0.3919
yep those are in synthetic tests or very heavy multithreaded applications in non gaming applications zen4 is actually more efficient at 88w based on what computerbase found but i assume most people are looking at gaming performance 7950x is 14 faster,0.0,0.912,0.088,0.3912
i have a 2080ti and usually compares with 6800xt maybe a little better so average 1440p performance would probably be around 62 or 63,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.3832

mine has been stable 30 for about a week now tested high loads like cinebench occt and a bit of prime95 along with some games in terms of light loads there is just normal desktop usage obviously if i end up getting crashes i will just tune it back up is there a reliably way to test these low loads scenarios outside of general windows use,0.032,0.895,0.073,0.3818

you most of the time need all core workloads to reach that but not all workloads are the same for example on my underclocked 11700f system aida64 fpu stress draws more power than whatever cinebench tests i run and something like prime95 is supposed to draw a fair bit more than these tests too,0.063,0.814,0.123,0.3716

i think it varies heavily by the game being benchmarked the anandtech review you sent showed the 12600k being faster than the 5800x3d in more games than not and often by a large margin other reviews like ltt corroborate this,0.0,0.937,0.063,0.3612

man i got the normal 5800x a long while before the 5800x3d variant dropped and i cannot even see myself needing more performance than this for a long while the 3d variant is awesome but the entire 5000 lineup should age really well imo especially with the crazy power requirements of new parts,0.063,0.834,0.102,0.2833

3700x is still a decent cpu maybe amd will surprise us with another am4 cpu while new am5 cpus come out there was a rumor,0.0,0.913,0.087,0.2732
it depends on your use case imho i upgraded from an r51600 to an r75700x i did not notice anything with games since the titles i enjoy right now are not cpu heavy but video editing was night and day,0.0,0.945,0.055,0.2732

it is surprising since it costs nearly double of what a regular 5800x does and isnt that much faster its just marketing doing its work i guess,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.2732

isnt the 12th gen just as cheap since it can do ddr4 as well,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.2732
thats surprising it has almost half as much cache as ps3 had ram so youd think that would affect performance,0.0,0.9,0.1,0.2732
for certain games,0.0,0.488,0.512,0.2732

1 the extra speed only really matters at lowish resolutions an with a high end card also with a 4090 raptorlake and zen4 jump ahead 2 those examples you point out lost most of their value and near substitutes like the 4770k and 6700k are even cheaper,0.091,0.775,0.134,0.2716
i hate linustechtips theyre more entertainment than actual reporting on hardware hardwareunboxed and gamersnexus are my favourite youtube channels for hardware der8 is also interesting,0.121,0.689,0.19,0.2716
after watching zen 4 and raptor lake all i can say is that both presentations were low key an advertisement for people to go buy either a 5800x3d or 12700k this is really funny as a consumer,0.058,0.854,0.088,0.2716
even cheap ddr5 will probably outperform it but its almost certainly not worth paying a thousand bucks to change platforms,0.075,0.799,0.125,0.2633
i went from 3700x to 5800x3d the other day but barely seeing an improvement having issues with it not boosting hah,0.106,0.745,0.149,0.2618
theres plenty 1600 is an insane price point i get their attempt to push value here but its not crypto boom anymore were looking at a price increase of 900 removing crypto inflating demand,0.099,0.772,0.128,0.2617
but why wouldn t it run at lower clock speeds it s using less power so shouldn t it be slower unless your thermal throttling wouldn t more power give you better cpu performance,0.081,0.808,0.111,0.2617

what the advantage 5800x3d have over 5900x if any for gaming and normal browsing,0.0,0.867,0.133,0.25
looks like a nasty bottleneck as well talking like 18 or something if i recall rightly from userbenchmark gonna just have to pull the trigger at some point because thats substantial performance loss,0.148,0.628,0.224,0.25
how do you undervolt a 5800x3d i came from a 5900x and its already an improvement but all pbo options are now absent in my bios gigabyte x570i aorus pro wifi,0.0,0.931,0.069,0.25
unless all the cores are hitting the max boost speed which for the lower speed of the x3d seems to be the case at least ime for regular 5000 series you are correct but the boost speed of the x3d is significantly lower so having any core hit the max isnt an issue,0.075,0.833,0.092,0.25

repeat it a few times maybe you manage to convince yourself,0.0,0.818,0.182,0.25
no 13900k has more cache for example you can look at 13900k 90w numbers and it pretty much matches 7950x at 90w 13600k cannot match 13900k at 90w,0.07,0.828,0.102,0.25
zen 4 and rpl are faster than it on average not anywhere i care timmy want to run his dudebro shooter at 600 fps get intel but the 5800x3d just happens to overlap with all my needs ranging from europa universalis 4 to skyrim creation kit,0.04,0.877,0.083,0.2467
am5 7600x or 7700x makes absolutely no sense vs 13600k or 13700k not true on the gaming market the longevity of the plateform give am5 an edge against lga1700 who is already eol and what we see right now on am4 confort the value of a long lived plateform 13600k and 13700k have an advantage in value today only if productivity workload are involved,0.069,0.833,0.098,0.2441
yeah userbenchmarks blatant shilling probably hurts intel more than it helps,0.192,0.495,0.313,0.2415
no its because the 3d chip has a new method of putting more cache stacked onto the chip so it has better latency and ram usage,0.078,0.811,0.112,0.2415
oh youre right looks like its not important for gpus though,0.122,0.687,0.191,0.2283
5600x3060 ti and 3600 or faster ram can easily max ow on lower detail settings i hope ow2 is the same i know on high details it is more demanding than ow1,0.123,0.728,0.148,0.228
yeah on amazon its right now and the 13600k is with the 12700k at at is the 5600x which is less than half the cost of the 5800x3d the 5900x is while at a similar price to the 5800x3d so this headline is really weird and oddly specific,0.04,0.882,0.078,0.228
i don t really mess with overclocking and such from my understanding this particular chip is one of the few by amd that you cannot change the electrical settings on there may be a back end way to do it but i don t know how but yeah the cpu is a beast,0.038,0.905,0.056,0.2272

so iam currently running a 1600x paired with a 5700 iam doing video cutting and gaming when i am gaming the gpu gets to like 90100 in some scenarious which is completly fine but my cpu is on 2050 am i right that swapping the cpu in this case wouldnt effect the performance where the gpu hits her limits,0.022,0.922,0.056,0.2263

there isnt a game in which 5800x3d is slower compared to any other cpu in 5xxx series at least i havent seen a single benchmark that shows so it either offers the same average fps or much higher average fps also all games will see a boost in 01 and 1 lows with 5800x3d so even if your average fps isnt higher games will run a lot smoother,0.028,0.93,0.042,0.2263

try to set your ram and voltages as in my screenshot pay attention to effective clocks and of course dont hit 70ºc if possible a couple of silent fans on top of the case pushing cool air into the cpu socket will do you can also try disabling l1 and l2 hardware prefetchers in bios for benchmarks but enable them back for gaming,0.05,0.872,0.078,0.2144

your missing the point the comparison is between the most expensive 4080 vs the cheapest 4090 would you by strix 4080 for the pretty much the same price as the cheapest 4090 and leave 30 performance on the table,0.08,0.845,0.075,0.2023

power is not what is needed though so if silicon runs stable at lower v it uses less power producing less heat this can in turn let it run faster before reaching the same power,0.059,0.833,0.108,0.2023

the non max will work just fine,0.0,0.769,0.231,0.2023
if youre just setting it up an easy way to confirm it is applied is to open pbo tuner and try to apply it if it is applied it will spit out a nothing to change result i would also suggest the high performance mode in windows power options to keep idle clocks up as 30 can cause some low idle stability issues,0.033,0.922,0.045,0.2023
i have a 360mm aio and when playing mw2 cpu temps were 75cand i could feel the heat dissipate from the rad the cpu can cause higher room temps more so if you sit close to ur pc,0.0,0.95,0.05,0.2023

lets wait for the 40804070 reviews there is such a large spec gap between the 4080 and 4090 that it feels like the 4090 should have been a ti or even a titan version the halo nvidia product is always a beast but dont apply this to every 4000 series card just yet,0.0,0.965,0.035,0.1901
at 4k the 2080ti is something like  1 of rtx3070 nearly the same so just compare with rtx3070 rtx4090 is 26times faster at 4k 1440p i have to look little bit deeper at the numbers but should be around 23times faster,0.0,0.956,0.044,0.1901

also 1080p tests are often gpu bottlenecked still in like a third of hwus cpu benchmarks they are gpu bound its not a problem since the goal is to explain to more casual viewers they dont need to buy an unnecessarily expensive cpu but for academic purposes like this its not great,0.077,0.781,0.142,0.1863
i also expect that the 5800x3d will be the cheapest of its kind because it was a first time now they can charge up with the massive hype its not even cheap so that scares me,0.07,0.84,0.089,0.1832
sure it matters for the actual hpc and cloud machines or local server or whatever but thats outside the purview of the average consumer once youre talking about scientific applications youre a bit outside the which one gives me the most fps in cod crowd which is who i assume the overwhelming majority of these benchmark sites are geared towards,0.0,0.954,0.046,0.1779

such results depend on the selected games have a look at this thread most reviewers have the 13600k outperform the 7600x if you average every review it outperforms every zen 4 chip in gaming so depending on the games you play the 7600x might be faster but i wouldnt expect that to be the case for most people,0.0,0.969,0.031,0.1779

its so hard to find relevant comparisons between an 8700k and the newest stuff thanks for taking the time even if im not playing gw2 this is really making me realize how absolutely dated the 8700k is starting to get for high fps gaming wild in my mind its still new and high end,0.057,0.892,0.051,0.1568
no you can t staple 2x lower cards together  but you could run lower settings that give you 60 more performance without compromising image quality all that much in most situations there are very few situations where you need a baseline level of performance and anything less won t be functional,0.11,0.806,0.084,0.1557

i dont know about this 13700kf is 80 eur more expensive than the 5800x3d where i live am4 motherboards are cheaper 13700kf draws a lot more power youll probably need a better cooler youll likely want ddr5 with it while the 5800x3d doesnt care similar performance i cant see myself choosing the 13700kf considering the above,0.048,0.875,0.077,0.1461
im not exactly sure but probably comes down to silicon lottery and thermal throttling no two chips are the same not even if they re the same brand and model the better binned ones could have some thermal headroom to undervoltoverclock undervolting is also overclocking btw since you re running it at a higher frequency at the same voltage,0.068,0.871,0.061,0.1454

not as big a difference as the insanely overpriced motherboards and expensive ddr5 have made those are the real issues for amd the 5800x3d is good but its not better than zen4 except for a handful of specific games if their platform was 100 cheaper overall zen4 would be doing well,0.058,0.856,0.086,0.1258

your motherboard setup should allow for undervolting but only for all cores not individual ones and setting a custom clock speed and voltage must be done per ccx not per core,0.0,0.952,0.048,0.1154
okay but where is this actually published on amds website as ryzen 5000s stock specification their own webpage says up to 3200mhz 5950x 5800x3d even amd themselves didnt test zen3 at 3733mhz for their zen4 benchmark charts they did it at 3600mhz why not 3733mhz if thats their own spec,0.0,0.971,0.029,0.1154
but its not necessarily equal where are you supposed to draw the line if you are overclocking the absolute limit of whats possible ye like with ddr5 why do we stop at 6000mhz because that is the zen 4 sweetspot while aldraptor can go higher,0.058,0.874,0.068,0.1154

low cap kits though plus those kits are 300 itll be months before we see kits with large gains over ddr4 as it stands ryzen 5000 series can handle up to 5100mhz according to my asus qvl the goal currently is 8400mhz for the industry until we see closer to 60007000mhz on 16gb sticks its not going to make a higher difference over ddr4,0.032,0.931,0.037,0.0772

i bought 7700x at launch i will upgrade to 7700x3d then upgrade to 8700x3d and 9700x3d i think you lose big time when intel announces 14th gen cpu with brand new architecture using new process that does 8ghz with 3x more l2 cache resulting in 40 ipc improvement and you cant install it on your 600 motherboard,0.047,0.901,0.052,0.0772

yes it does if you want to go one step further you can reduce your fan speed since it heats up less but fans consume very little electricity as far as i know so its not worth it,0.06,0.824,0.116,0.0658

isnt that just because it was released later with the newer bios hence more validation and thus they lifted more limits unless the mobo physically changed other than the bios chip or that specific tweaks were only included in the max bios it should be able to achieve exactly the same speeds,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

ive been playing ace combat 7 and gta5 online im in the same boat lol theres also the issue of my using an atx psu and matx mobo in a sama im01 so if i want a 3080 makes more sense first over the 5800x3d ill need to swap to a sff psu then once im there i might as well drop in the 5800x3d and maybe some faster ramand you can see why ive held off,0.092,0.804,0.104,-0.0056

the point here is that the 5800x3d can keep up with the 4090 the comparison with the 13900k was to show that at 4k the difference in performance is miniscule and at 4k the memory overclock doesnt matter as much since even with a 4090 youre still likely to be gpu bound,0.021,0.979,0.0,-0.0191

there are plenty of games that are cpu bound they just arent included in reviews very often because reviewers usually just test stuff from their gpu test suite or they arent testing the right situations in the game multiplayer for example can hit cpus hard but is never tested because its not something which can be done repeatably,0.021,0.979,0.0,-0.0516

ram speed depends on imc which is in the cpu the qvl is just what they validated at the time the only place youll see higher memory speeds because of the motherboard is where the slots are physically closer to cpu andor isolated on its own pcb layer hence why itx boards typically are the kings of memory oc,0.038,0.931,0.031,-0.1027

question when these graphics show 65w 88w 125w limits on the 13900k etc is that a hard limit on the amount of power the chip can use or is that the base tdp with turbo being able to pass that limit the club365 article listed a system power consumption graph with the total power far exceeding the limits above,0.024,0.976,0.0,-0.1027

a lot of people are lowering the power limit as you can cut power usage and hardly lose and performance on the other end of the spectrum you can get a bit more power if you cool it really well but at this point air coolers are keeping them at 60 degrees in some cases,0.085,0.856,0.06,-0.1045

exactly this plus there are routine sales now seeing it under 350 usd why not get 12900k gaming performance in your existing rig im also willing to bet that with newer games that addition of 3d v cache will become far more apparent if it wasnt for me needing the cores more than cache i would have grabbed one over the 5900x,0.025,0.975,0.0,-0.128

it really doesnt make sense to buy zen3 if you are looking for a new platform even on a budget the 13600k is better than the 5950x at multithreading and cheaper than 5800x3d there are 6xx series motherboards you can put a 13600k in and you can upgrade to a 13900k in a few years as well zen 3 is much more of a dead end than rpl,0.068,0.858,0.074,-0.1477

not even close intels new chips already beat the 5800x3d at gaming on average and then by far in just about all other compute only took 6 months despite intel being at a node disadvantage the 16nm 1080ti was unsurpassed by amd for 3 years despite amd having the node advantage at 7nm,0.053,0.909,0.038,-0.2023

i disagree with your definition of flex buy i bought a 4090 because i have a 4k120 tv and i was playing at 144hz before getting that tv i use it as primary monitor im not flexing on anyone in fact i probably wont even tell anybody i have it unless im asked i dont believe most of the people are buying these just to show off,0.044,0.926,0.03,-0.2023

i think most manufacturers do that for now i think its probably going to change eventually with a hardware revision though as the huge heat sink is expensive to produce and has poor case compatibility and it really isnt needed the 4080 only uses about the same amount of power than the 3080 so in theory they could use a heatsink of the same size,0.048,0.916,0.036,-0.2023

also amd has been tested with 3200mhz ram while 3600mhz is the real sweetspot also theyve used lower ddr5 memory comparing the 12900k and 13900k,0.084,0.916,0.0,-0.296
it is clocked lower than the 5800x which already has 105w tdp142w max draw which is for heavy allcore loads 7080w for poorly threaded games is about right the batshit performance comes from the massive amount of l3 cache greatly reducing memoryrelated delays cpus spend a lot of time doing nothing apparently,0.042,0.958,0.0,-0.296

the 13700k got tdp of 125w and turbo of 253wz that means that he will use all the time 253w no it will only hit high power draw numbers when running stuff that produces a lot of heat cinebench runs quite hot compared to games,0.049,0.951,0.0,-0.296

thats fair but i and other reviewers tested 3200 3600 and 3800 for the 5800x3d and it just doesnt matter much for practical applications its a different beast to the rest of the lower cache lineup due to the cache that all said and done i run 3800cl16 myself with it just because i can but its not a must,0.068,0.903,0.029,-0.3096
its not a waste if it makes the experience buttery smooth eliminating all the stutters and weak 1 lows its very dependent on the situation and game you cannot make a broad statement such as that of course it depends on your budget and the rest of the system as well,0.124,0.794,0.082,-0.3111

its not a temp issue or defective cpu as this is an rma replacement for another that was going the same thing ive made a thread about it,0.104,0.896,0.0,-0.4404
while raptor lake is certainly faster it s also on a dead end platform am5 is the only platform with future longevity at this point,0.155,0.758,0.087,-0.4404
yes undervolting basically raises the frequencyvoltage curve so you re running the same frequency at a lower voltage lower voltage requires lower power and hence less heat,0.211,0.703,0.086,-0.4404

according to some reviews 7000 series gaming performance isnt affected even with 65w ecomode we dont know how the next vcache iteration will handle the voltages zen 4 uses voltage limitation was the reason 5800x3d was locked to lower frequencies,0.105,0.86,0.035,-0.4508

so what is the logic behind this if you lower the voltage the amperes need to go up for the same amount of power according to ohms law i would have thought lower current with higher voltage would give lower temperatures instead i have heard about undervolting from other sources too so i am just curious about the explanation for it,0.104,0.855,0.041,-0.4654
its slightly slower but not by any meaningful amount the advantage disappears at 4k which you should be running the 4090 at anyway,0.198,0.713,0.089,-0.4666

my 6800k is crying for me to put it out of its very highly overclocked misery i actually have the spot of a few 3d mark tests explicitly because i have a new gpu and an almost 7 year old cpu and that s even with dropping my core by 100 mhz due to reduced stability,0.133,0.867,0.0,-0.8096

lga1700 is dead already and am5 will likely go for 4 generations or so yes but am5 platform cost is outrageous while am4 b350 platform was very cheap and fairly priced back then am5 7600x or 7700x makes absolutely no sense vs 13600k or 13700k,0.19,0.767,0.043,-0.8245

rpl is killing it from what i can tell its a much better priceperf offering than z4 and is brutalizing z3 outside of some niche stuff like 5800x3d im not sure what youre on about amd is being forced into incredible sales prices on z3 just to move stock i can get a 5900x for almost 50 less than i could last year new,0.191,0.734,0.075,-0.8542
in my head im seeing the astrix next to the word longer but in all seriousness im the type of person that buys every generation for both cpu and gpu even have a 4090 upgraded from a 3080ti dont judge me but i think this is the first gen that ill give it a pass im an idiot that blows money but even i cannot see the point in these when gaming at 4k,0.125,0.875,0.0,-0.8573

thats actually gonna be crazy but doesnt it cause you problems im not sure on your use case but the 880k could only just about get me above 50fps on lowest at 1080p paired with r7 360 and at one point 1060 but that only barely got me over 60 until i got the 1600 cpu,0.179,0.821,0.0,-0.8777

yes but why go with the strix for the 4080 then you are getting the worst deal out of all the already bad 4080 deals not like it s hard to get a 4080 of your choice these days even the founders edition when it dropped was in stock for 3 hours although that one does only drop every other week it seems,0.215,0.74,0.045,-0.9374
