i felt the speed difference i had 2400 mhz ram and i upgraded to this one at 3000 mhz boost is about 10 in overall performance i got it for the new pc but just checked how it goes with my current pc hope it goes better in new pc i have ryzen 3 2200g with which i tested the ram but new one is ryzen 5 3400g hope all goes well,0.0,0.786,0.214,0.9437
its not a 3000mhz ram its 2733 with xmp u can boost ur mhz but thats depending on your prosessor speed and how much over clocking urs system does so b careful before buying that kind of stuff the ram is good if u do not do heavy gamming or render it will perfectly works ,0.0,0.768,0.232,0.9346
