i agree that rt is important rumor is the increase in rdna 3 over 2 is more than double in rt i guess well have to wait and see i would say that if the 7900xt was 90 of the rt perf of 4090 and cost like 1000 it would be a great alternative,0.0,0.733,0.267,0.9231

i know but the fact that best known leakers keep saying that its a good sign mark my words rdna3 will have the same price treatment as zen4 no price bump meaning that 7900xt msrp will be the same as 6900xt and so on amd needs to make the 4080 and 4090 irrelevant for its price if the performance its right there things will get interesting,0.037,0.789,0.174,0.9081

only one question

the phrasing is really bad but there is no chance they are launching november 3rd if the partners were already working on the rdna 3 aibs something would have leaked by now curious to see what we can expect,0.175,0.708,0.117,-0.4012
the fact that raytracing in general is mentioned very little with rdna3 should tell everyone it will not be impressive in that aspect,0.109,0.891,0.0,-0.4023
ive digested a lot of tech info over the last year and i dont think the rumors are wild at all i have little doubt rdna 3 is going to be a major pita for rtx 40 especially when amd has bigger profit margins to work with,0.118,0.821,0.061,-0.4033
"this post gets basically all the model numbers and chip names wrong lol

this is 7900 nonxt the lowest sku of the navi 31 chip which is the biggest chip in the rdna3 lineup and is launching first",0.131,0.805,0.064,-0.4404
"so many rumours of 3035ghz clock speeds didnt hold any water i guess

yup had to eat crow there not sure why amd got stuck at rdna2 speeds with the new node while nvidia have again taken the lead",0.099,0.901,0.0,-0.4519
6950xt launched at 1000 and traded blows with the 1500 3090 i have no doubt amd will do it all over again with rdna 3,0.179,0.763,0.057,-0.4939
in many cases rdna2s performance might drop off at higher resolutions because with larger data sets you run the risk of lower l3 cache hit rates when that happens it means more accesses to the comparatively slow vram and overall slower performance can mean somewhat higher power draw as well,0.117,0.844,0.039,-0.5106
amd hasnt lied lately and they did claim gpu leadership with rdna 3 some time ago they have the mcm ace up their sleeves to really murder the high end time will tell soon enough not long to wait ,0.116,0.834,0.051,-0.5871
"your mind is in the right place rdna 3 has potential to be extremely disruptive if they can 2x performance of each previous sku and price aggressively even a 7800 xt might match the 4090 in raster

edit should clarify the 7800 xt could match 4090 in raster in some cases",0.094,0.906,0.0,-0.5984
 my understanding is that rdna 2 is classified as level 2 and ampere as level 3 im not sure why other than several things i have read in the past that indicate some sort of bvh processing deficiency those sources could have been wrong i dont recall what articles i read that mentioned that,0.099,0.901,0.0,-0.6202
"are we looking at different cards right now rdna3 pricing is completely murdering the 4080 and to a big extent the 4090 too

it wont match or beat it but its mostly there for 600 lower msrp",0.141,0.859,0.0,-0.6805
today ill decide whether or not ill get a 68006900xt or wait for rdna 3,0.337,0.663,0.0,-0.6808
" no no no nobody has said there will be new rt units

it would be a lie if they publicly claim there will be enhanced rt capabilities and release the same rt units with rdna3",0.176,0.824,0.0,-0.6808
rdna 2 wasnt that secret there were lots of information available on makes models it was a tad late but rdna 3 has been closely guarded it has driven nvidia to unseen levels of paranoia of losing the crown not seen in a decade,0.134,0.866,0.0,-0.7096
"it is 32 rdna3 cus not rdna2 ones

the question really no one has an answer to is what that actually translates to in real life performance is 2x the alus actually going to offer 2x the real life performance i really doubt it if it would that would make navi31 3x as fast as an rx 6900 xt while using less and worse silicon than nvidia",0.114,0.886,0.0,-0.7968
