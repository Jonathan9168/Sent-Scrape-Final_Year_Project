thanks steve i bought a 3070 black gaming from evga because it was one of only a few in stock at my local micro center i really wanted the 3080 but this had plenty in stock so might as well its a huge upgrade from my 1080ti which i loved dearly nearly all my title games have maxed itself to 144fps or close to it on 1440p im pleased if its meant to be a 2080ti replacement im still happy i have a 2080ti for half the price,0.0,0.735,0.265,0.9796
i feel like they shouldve contacted psu companies ahead of time and asked them to start making 12 pin included power supplies also if they use this connector and make similar ones for cpu power seta power and motherboard power it will look nice but that especially wont be happening for a long time since motherboards must support it as well seta things wont have a problem though imagine a 2 12 pins for a motherboard and 1 for the cpu it would look nice its a great idea for 12 pin power but they couldve handled it better,0.0,0.762,0.238,0.9775
the card in a purely objective sense is good in that it is doing nothing horrible thats high praise seriously gamers nexus the card is awesome improvement compared to previous gen and the price point is pretty good again compared to previous gen its ok to say it even if amd releases a better card tomorrow,0.023,0.6,0.377,0.9775
i have an actual rtx 3070 founders edition and i have to say it is loud for sure underload and it gets quite hot though i am thinking of getting a triple fan mount that i can blow more air to the gpu as the rtx 3070 is loud and concerning with the heat i rather not know my gpu is running like 80 fan speed but more like 60 but the gpu is just not designed to be cooled as great as it could sure nice cooling looks but is kinder impractical as it leaves the gpu running hot and loud,0.0,0.766,0.234,0.9765
i didnt pay shit for my zotac twin oc 3070 and it honestly does really well the monitor i use is the samsung odyssey g5 and it runs super well at native 1440p at 144hz so i dont see what there is to honestly bitch about its a pretty good graphics card and to be quite fair i literally see no difference in image quality between 1440p and 4k res 4k res is utterly useless to me when it comes to quality and performance 1440p is perfectly fine,0.082,0.614,0.304,0.9702
man i dont wanna wait but im soooooo very torn have a computer built around working perfectly with up to a 3080 but bought a friends 1660 super oc edition to tide me over ive been ready for more horsepower since i got it lol,0.05,0.574,0.376,0.9695

love your videos with great clear info and humor i was thinking to get 3070 if available in store lol to play sim racing assetto corsa competizione with triple screens maybe max settings or somethings the card can handle i am yet to see any youtube video try out triple screens thanks in advance,0.0,0.681,0.319,0.9643
go gamers nexus the best most detailed reviews i love your work very interesting and obviously done with a lot of love keep up i hope to contribute somehow myself as soon as i get back on my feet a big hello from a poet in croatia,0.0,0.654,0.346,0.9639
thanks for a really informative video liked and subbed i literally just want to play at 4k 60fps and will be using a 4k tv high end samsung and would like to know if 3070 will guarantee that level of performance or if i really need a 3080 for 4k just to reiterate i dont need mad high refresh rate gaming 4k 60fps ultra settings is my goal any help appreciated,0.0,0.711,0.289,0.9628
i have a question for the channel i have in hand a nvidia 3070 fe and a msi 3070 gaming x trio which one should i keep what is the best card to keep better silicon from fe or better cooling from msi who has higher quality for parts and transistors fe or msi please i need an expert insight since you benchmark and are familiar with 3rd party cards thank you,0.0,0.734,0.266,0.9623
in brazil they are around 80000 usd and a 3080 is like 950130000 usd that is if you find a good deal currently a decent branded say evga new 2080 super is anywhere from 450000 to 650000brl which is 900120000usd so in theory the 3080 and the 3070 should be expressivly cheaper than any 2080 super problem is the 2000 series here in brazil started high and only went up even when the cards got old and the 3000 series came out same for the 1000 series now the 3000 is supposed to be much more accessible price wise than the 1000 and 2000 series so well have to wait and see if one can actually get better prices for the 3070 and 3080 than with last generations,0.019,0.824,0.156,0.9613
great 45minutes video from igor and now your 34 minutes on top linus approach of 10 minutes thats gonna be a great evening much love from germany guys and keep up your great work,0.0,0.605,0.395,0.9601
was really happy and fortunate i was able to buy the 3070 founders edition today it was a much needed upgrade since i m nowhere as knowledgeable compared to my friends with computers and had been using my first pc they put together back in 2014 using a gtx 760 i recently put together my new pc about 3 weeks ago hoping to get the 3070 on the 15th which would ve been a nice birthday present but glad i was able to purchase one today love your video and i can t wait to get mine on nov 5th,0.0,0.802,0.198,0.9597
im sitting on an sli 770 set this card is looking really good though id like to see what the amd cards are going to look like and the cost my whole system is over 6 years old now with the 4770k and ddr3 1866 ram i would love to build a whole new system if i had the money its seem like a great time for upgrades right now if not for everything else in the world going on,0.0,0.784,0.216,0.9583
personally i target high refresh rate 1080p gaming so even this is not really overkill i have a 165hz monitor and this card paired with one of the new ryzen 5000s will enable me to get that in a lot of games so this really is a perfect pairing at its price point for those targeting that performance level even 1440p isnt hitting those super high refresh rates like 144 on a 10900k so the 3070 isnt overkill for those targeting that level of performance either clearly if you want high refresh rate 1440p gaming a 3080 is where you want to go as of this moment maybe the new amd cards will also satisfy that need but its clear that the 3070 is priced very perfectly right now with such huge performance overall,0.015,0.824,0.162,0.9578
title kinda clickbaity but great video regardless 3070 seems like the perfect card for 1440p gaming thank you,0.0,0.454,0.546,0.9572
well this one was hella easy to get i just ordered mine on best buy will be here tommorrow looks like the extra step kept a lot of the botters away or they just didnt give a dayum about this card for me i been using ti 1070 s in sli it was time to upgrade and being that its best buy during the holidays i will just trade this one in if the 3080 shows up between now and jan 16,0.0,0.788,0.212,0.9571
dang it may be a joke to many in a way it is all the scalpers availability going back to gddr6 and the constant amd 1upping but i had the cash ready after saving up for over a year to get a 3090 and finally replace my 1080ti true there are plenty of people to whom even that would be luxury or wouldnt want to drop so much on a card butto then miss grabbing it with all the bot issues stock issues the silly poscap stuff in a way im almost glad i couldnt get one yet i never adopted the rtx 20 series as to me it just wasnt worth it in terms of price or performance plus nothing from the red team really beat my card enough to justify replacing it so ended up saving most and upgrading my storage instead i now have 75tb of total storage in my main pc all of it ssds thanks to going for what i wanted and how long ago i got it versus going for dealscheaper options it is rather an eclectic mix of brands now samsung adata sabrent and crucial lol,0.026,0.857,0.116,0.9571
now that availability and prices are approaching levels i am comfortable with i m going to replace my msi gtx 1070 with an fe rtx 3070 so this video is just perfect thanks so much for including the 1070 in the tables really helps understand the gain,0.0,0.707,0.293,0.945
i really enjoy your videos mate great energy and i think youre pretty entertaining also,0.0,0.336,0.664,0.9412
interesting makes sense why my 2 year old asus dual with a 338w power limit happily lives in the 2100mhz region and gets almost 10500 in port royal and 20 on all the other 2080ti comparisons they must be using a bone stock 2080ti plus i game at 4k so definite pass weird thing is paid 1189 aud new back in oct 2018 which is about 800usd prior to covid price hike wasnt such a bad deal for a good few years 4k gaming my port royal at 10272 which is more than 2000 points more than most reviews are showing a 2080ti doing and 2k more than a 3070 even in its preferred resolution and feature set even when using a i74770k port royal was 9600 points with gpu not even overclocked a good 1300 more points than a rtx 3070 at 1440p,0.013,0.865,0.121,0.9406
i feel liked i lucked out when the gigabyte gaming oc was on sale for 529 brand new on amazon last month much better than the 2070s and 5700xt i had compared to those the card is basically silent around 70 fan speed even at 100 with 3 fans compared to 2 on the other cards its nowhere near as loud ocuv is great and the card runs a lot cooler too,0.0,0.782,0.218,0.9403
videos like this help a lot specially to people like me who are building a pc for the first time and dont know much about components im still trying to determine if im going overboard with a 3070 to run any architecture software and play skyrim with mods in 1080 how much is too much you know thanks for the video really appreciate,0.0,0.767,0.233,0.9373
i have the asus tuff 3070 and the auros 3060 and either one is great but 1440p monster is the 3070 i won the 3060 and bought a prebuilt for the 3070 and then changed everything about it and i love it and the 490z msi,0.0,0.744,0.256,0.9371
didnt nvidia say that the 3070 was going to be either on par or slightly better than the 2080 ti wonder why its slightly worse i know its only slightly but false advertising is still false advertising there was like 2ish games where the 3070 might have won but the oc on the 2080 ti just over did xd,0.027,0.755,0.218,0.9371
honestly i would get the 3070 for mainly 1440p or super good 1080p and maybe even light 4k on modern warfare fortnite like i ve seen it and i think it s a good card even tho it s pretty expensive but if you have the chance to get it msrp honestly i d do it,0.027,0.658,0.315,0.9337
i want one but not at triple the price i can almost afford retail price 3090s right now but never going to get one would love a 3080ti but they will sell out before theyre even fully listed love the 30 series launch,0.0,0.744,0.256,0.9294
so if i were to game at 4k with this card should i go for a highend high refresh rate monitor or just say fuck it and go for 4k 60hz personally i play aaa titles and shootersracers but not competitively i m more of a tryhard casual that also likes pretty looking games lol edit,0.037,0.702,0.261,0.9293
so dont waste your money but in future titles the 8gb of ram will be pretty limiting in 4k even in a few months we will see games that will uses more than 8gb in 4k so definitly a good card for 1440p but for 4k not in the long run appart from that just discovered the channel and i like it one new sub,0.0,0.81,0.19,0.9277
i wish it had g6x but yea its still quite good for its price d i would recommend it for my friends who have old 980 tis though by showing them this video,0.0,0.658,0.342,0.9265
oh wow this looks like a pretty good deal scalpers allow us to introduce ourselves,0.0,0.386,0.614,0.9231
great content and conclusion love my 2070 super at 1440p maybe another year of aaa rtxon will see if new consoles up game engines,0.0,0.633,0.367,0.9217
thanks for the awesome review again gn congratulations on 1m,0.0,0.314,0.686,0.9201
from rtx2060 ryzen 5 2600 then upgraded to 3070 and a year later which is last week upgraded my cpu to 13600k with z790 board i m super happy with my rig now 180200fps in warzone 2 1080p lownormal settings 250300fps apex low settings temp is quite disappointing but it s not the worst with 75c at 99100 usage overall love my 3070 planning to skip 40 series and gonna buy 50 series,0.063,0.749,0.188,0.9185
from these numbers it would seem in the best case scenario it is marginally faster than a 2080ti and in those instances by a negligible margin in a few cases its closer to a 2080s than a 2080ti good value regardless but surely misleading by nvidia to say faster than a 2080ti how much better is a strix 2080ti at stock vs a fe 2080ti maybe that would help justify the statement somewhat,0.045,0.734,0.221,0.9178
i m for sure getting a 3070 when they get back in stock i have a year to save up money for my first build i ve been watching your videos and your 3070 build tutorial inspired be my budget is 2k so i have everything planned out love the content,0.0,0.756,0.244,0.9169
well is not faster then a 2080ti but it gets extremely close is pretty much 95 of its performance for less that half of the price its a great deal the is stock but with the oc other brands do i will be on par,0.0,0.766,0.234,0.9169
3070 is perfect for 1440 if your not playing ultra settings the new games like watchdogs legion is asking for over 8gb of ram at 1440 with ultra settings even in a mix of high and ultra so keep that in mind for this reason alone not speed but memory i now have to go with 3080 or 2080ti lol 2080ti has more memory and same speed as 3070 so this might be the best choice when prices for them comes down to earth,0.03,0.823,0.147,0.9153
yeah using the 1070 this might actually be the first card to be a reasonable upgrade until now every upgrade either wouldnt have improved performance really impressively or was just too expensive still im going to wait for partner models to be released all the reviews to be found a good availability for all cards and rdna2 for seeing what the competition does and if switching brands could actually be worth it so im expecting to upgrade mid 2021 until then i just hope my 1070 wont die on me,0.026,0.809,0.165,0.915
thanks for the review gn congrats for having the best review channel in existence,0.0,0.441,0.559,0.9136
steve i know you guys are so busy but can you squeeze in a relook at the 5700xt its now essentially tied with with the 2070 super and it started just faster than the 2060 super,0.0,0.749,0.251,0.9136
after years out of gaming i build a pretty baller pc 3900xt rog strix mother board pcie 4 m2 ect and have been waiting to get a rtx 3080 with no luck so bought an rxt 2070 super a week ago to get me buy and now my second choice a rtx 3070 is sold out instantaneous also god i hope amd blows the rtx 3080 outta the water and leave all the scalpers with there nvidia cards fingers crossed for a big navi 6800 or 6900,0.038,0.796,0.167,0.9136
i built my first pc the month before the first 30 series cards came out i got a 2060 super for 320 and i just upgraded to a 3070fe for 300 im so glad i waited and i hooked up this kid with my super for 150 he was upgrading from a 1650,0.0,0.783,0.217,0.913
can you run through a nvidia control panel settings guide and good base overclocking for this card that would help me out alot theres so many nvidia control pantl settings videos but none of them seem to work very well for my setup please help,0.0,0.744,0.256,0.9079
good review giving heaps of confidence to be happy with a 3070 and not needing a 3080,0.0,0.472,0.528,0.9062
gpu rendering any chance you could test 2 x rtx 3070 v 1 x rtx 3080 and maybe 3090 for blender gpu rendering with optixtrying to decide if its better to get 2 cheaper gpus or 1 high end gputhis might be a better comparison with 2 x rtx 3060 v 1 x rtx 3080 when they come out i would love to know the results this has to do with australian pricing,0.0,0.821,0.179,0.9001
i would go for a next gen console with really similar performance for 500 instead of a 1500 pc build you can also enjoy everything way better on a nice tv and a nice controller i want to say goodbye to drivers windows updates and all that bs not even mentioning the tons of different game platforms they just cant be all on steam can they,0.0,0.809,0.191,0.9001
you know it might benefit the gpu core to have its flow through design fan also flow through the card near or even between the gpu core and the ram they are relying solely on conductive cooling on the hottest components and then actively cooling the conductive material what if there were vent holes in the card itself in this area because its either vent the heat that builds up between the gpu coreram chipsmosfet where there is no contact with the cooler or incorporate a massive ihs that covers everything like they started doing with cpus only bigger plus with a fan being right on top of the gpu core already the only thing they would have to do to implement this is move some traces out of the way to allow for the airflow to physically pass through the card,0.015,0.878,0.107,0.8979
youre the best reviewer because youre realistic i love it thank you,0.0,0.423,0.577,0.8979
definitely an excellent card only marginally more power efficient over the 2080tis i would think the 8nm die shrink would allot more of a wattage to performance ratio but the die is much smaller and more compact and it only uses 10 less power than a 2080ti only real improvement i see is price thanks for another awesome and in depth review,0.101,0.646,0.253,0.8958
the 3070 is an amazing card i managed to get lucky and get mine in 2020 for msrp although i feel like its vram is going to be an issue in the future im seeing a few games almost touch the ceiling at 1440p itll be interesting to see how far future titles can push it,0.0,0.806,0.194,0.8957
so basically this card fills the small gap that existed between the 2080super and the 2080ti in some games it beats the 2080ti but in most games its closer to the 2080super oc than the 2080ti except 4k rtx path trace still tho the 2080super was a 700 card and this is just way better in terms of value for money hope amd wrecks it,0.0,0.85,0.15,0.8957
thanks for mentioning 970 hangers on like myself lol this is exactly the cars i was looking at i game some but not a ton so this looks like a good option,0.0,0.644,0.356,0.8934
i dont see the point in overclocking a system like this theres enough power to play games comfortably i play older games on older hardware and may never have a pc like this and watching the video was refreshing,0.0,0.704,0.296,0.891
honestly my 1070 does quite alright at 1440p think i can stretch it out another generation too many people just thirsty for the latest and greatest when they don t even need the upgrade a used vega56 for 150 off ebay would do most people just fine,0.0,0.776,0.224,0.8899
i miss the good old days when you could get superb great gpus for 300 bucks or less,0.062,0.506,0.432,0.8885
finally a perfect series 3000 review without spoiling 25 games this is the best video in the world for me and idc what everyone else thinks thank you very much,0.0,0.714,0.286,0.886
i think the 3060 ti is the better value as the 3070 isnt that much better for the price save the extra hundred or so on saving up for a 3090 later,0.0,0.695,0.305,0.886
so it is normal to stay with my rx 5700 non xt if i am happy with the performance now d jk for now ray tracing is too new and not something that i want and my gpu is perfectly fine for 1080p 144hz actually my ryzen 5 1600 is bottleneck most of the times,0.021,0.782,0.197,0.8854
i still wonder why reviewers sneer at dlss who cares what the card does to give the best graphics and frame rate i personally love control with rt on full never seen any game so realistic looking my 3080 run it at 110 to 130 fps with ultra settings dlss is amazing just because the competition doesnt have it is no reason to hate on it,0.075,0.733,0.192,0.8834
thanks for listening to audience about dlss i understand the purist stance on it but at least including it is the right move if the results are good enough that a lot of people can be comfortable using it,0.0,0.768,0.232,0.882
looks pretty good the 10 people that get to buy it must be very happy,0.0,0.543,0.457,0.8777
first time here subbed for sure i enjoyed this quite a bit i ll love you even more tho if you tell me what that yellow mouse is,0.0,0.686,0.314,0.8768
now what we need is an amd card that is able to outrun this at the 400 price point i dont think rdna2 is going to outpace the 1090 but i am hoping it is more than a 5700xt over again and actually aims up the stack a bit higher i remember reading the original anandtech article on the 2900xt way back in the day the first card released after the amd acquisition and the article was titled calling a spade a spade and they priced the card basically at 299 in the face of the 700 8800 gtx and 500 gts and it was about similar to the 8800 gts 320mb at around 400 and it actually sold all they could make but amd was glad to drop the card as quickly as possible and the 3870 was a far better successor fixing some of the performance issues heat problems and having much higher clock rate all at the same price i want that sort of competition again fk these 15002000 flagship cards that is a rip off no matter how fast they are its just a video card,0.045,0.848,0.106,0.8765
im only interested in zen3 and big navi but ill still watch to support gn for the outstanding work you do,0.111,0.479,0.41,0.875
considering on how well designed the card is then that means a lot of thought went into it therefore if we try to assume that the connector in the middle of the card was intentional then couldnt that mean they were hoping that mother board designers would design their mother boards or at least case wise for the card to stand upright rather than side ways so then the power cord is pointing down rather than towards you therefore there would be more support for the card in the case,0.0,0.885,0.115,0.8748
about 3070 because of your review 9 months ago instead of the 3080 i havent regretted it one time absolutely love the 3070 or rock solid video card and the driver support from nvidia has been amazingthank you,0.0,0.745,0.255,0.8743
its a good improvement over my 1070ti 2x but i play at 1080p and most games are good enough for me maybe next gen im looking forward to ryzen since i have i5 3470 quad core which is getting old,0.0,0.752,0.248,0.872

and to think that my rx 580 is still my best desktop gpu thats honestly pretty weird looking at this considering i have a 1440p monitor to use it with red dead 2 makes me turn the settings to around the lowest balanced preset to get smooth enough gameplay in 1440p on that card youre making me interested in upgrading kinda considering something on that system which i feel may be the gpu is causing the computer to occasionally hard lock itself forcing me to press the reset button i dont know though i am honestly kinda a cheap person i do have a laptop with an rtx 2060 maxq in it which is actually a bit better than my rx 580 but its a laptop also my desktop only has a ryzen 2600x to go with the rx 580 so i am wondering if i may need a cpu upgrade also to properly take advantage of the card in which case i might as well just build another computer,0.041,0.853,0.106,0.8688
really interested on the back of this i managed to get a 3070 aorus master as a really really lucky impulse buy the card as far as i m concerned is worth it as it was an upgrade from a 1060 6gb however i made the dumb mistake of paring this with a 60hz 1080p monitor i m now in a situation where my i7 7600k is running 75 and my gpu is running at 75 but my monitor is just not up to the task bottom line don t go and spend loads of money on a gpu if you have a crap monitor you won t notice the difference and you ll need another £400 to really see the difference in panels totally my 2 pence on the subject and any monitor recommendations would be great to receive sorry for the ramble here s a thumbs up,0.059,0.83,0.111,0.8635

i have rog strix 1070 i see that 3070fe does double as good in many scenarios and it supports raytracing while at it i am opening up a little savings account for it and i am looking forward to board partners presenting their versions obviously i would like an rog strix version because i like rog stuff,0.0,0.816,0.184,0.8555

i am really impressed with amd it looks like they have better performance and faster ray tracing what should i get if i am working with cad and rendering keyshot blender the type of the card is important nvidia vs amd also i have 3950x thinking about upgrading to the new 5950x but not really sure the vram if fine for me anyway 16 or 20 i will not pay for 3090 in any case my dilemma is between the top amd and the 3080ti spending aboute 1k i am also gaming but most of my time is working on my pc thanks,0.044,0.8,0.156,0.8471
i would be interested to know how much power is being drawn through the motherboards pcie slot 75w max spec and how much from the psus 8 pin pcie power connector 150w max spec surely this card is drawing more power than the official specifications for these i hope this gets the same mention as it did when the rx 480 first launched and was found to be drawing too much power from the motherboard,0.0,0.872,0.128,0.8402
me wow this is actually a great price to performance card also me as if itll actually sell for msrp,0.0,0.683,0.317,0.836
just ordered my pc from cyberpower with a 3070 and didn t know what to expect after seeing your video i m much more confident in the purchase your review was very well worded and your presentation is very clean subscribed,0.0,0.793,0.207,0.8351
asus 3070 dual oc is very impressive very happy with my purchase even knowing i paid nearly double msrp,0.0,0.671,0.329,0.8338
nice video tell me what i don t need save my money lol,0.0,0.476,0.524,0.8316

so was able to order my 3070 fe had to do it on my phone though at best buy i couldnt get them to add it to my cart on my pc so that was fun,0.0,0.81,0.19,0.83
i like how pc centrics says not to waste your money even though it is the rtx 2080ti a bit better and cheaper how can u go wrong with that and pc centrics owns a rtx 3090 and he says the rtx 3070 is a waste lol,0.06,0.693,0.248,0.83
another paper launch amazing another nvidia product that is nowhere to been seen guess fate is telling me to get amd this time around lets hope amd doesnt copy tense jensen rays decisions,0.0,0.774,0.226,0.8288
to be honest i think the 3070 is slightly overpriced might sound crazy but i think it should be about 450 below the price of a 3080 ps5 is coming out they have to bring out a card thats going to compete a little with next gen titles you might aswell just save a couple hundred xtra dollars and get a massive performance increase with the 3080,0.025,0.835,0.14,0.8271
i actually still want to get the rtx 3070 fe uk due to its minimalist look plus its quite good for rendering it seems i rather not go above £500 as its more of a upgrade to my existing gpu the gtx 1050 is not up for task for the long run sure its a good card but not enough for my needs my cpu however should be decent enough with the new gpu as i havent really met any true issues with my cpu yet i have the i77700k luckily the rtx 3070 isnt too much of a hungry card so ill be sticking with my 650w psu may or may not need to get another adapter to split a cable as my psu is not module but is corsair,0.036,0.85,0.114,0.8231
great tile to be a scalper can t find this card for under 1000i predict this 3070 will be the card of the year i need this card and i need the founders edition because i rock a tiny pclove my little cube but it limits which version of card i can rock the founders 3070 will be perfect one day when they actually have stocksad daybrand new everythinggigabyte x570 aurus pro wifiitx versionamd ryzen 5 3600 and rgb ram750 watt modular psueverything brand new but still using the gtx980lol 2015 card i ll get the 3070 when it is normal price and not literally doublecheck the prices atmliterally double on every cardcan t even find a 1080ti founders for under 1kwtf,0.0,0.935,0.065,0.8225

wow i just saw something verry interesting since i have the same cpu coolerdarkrock 4 i was thinking about moving the fan from front pushing air on cooler to backpulling air from cooler because the fan block 2 other ram slots to be used how are your temps using this metod compared to standard front mounting,0.048,0.767,0.185,0.802

i will say that although pc s are probably better in terms of performance and value the ps5 added another good reason to get a console with it immersive features on its controller,0.0,0.767,0.233,0.802
i dont play gta v but im a bit shocked to only see a 31 performance increase over the gtx 1080 in 1440p thirtyone percent in over four and a half years yes its a step down card xx80 to xx70 but this really shows how little the 2000 series improved over the 1000 series,0.076,0.744,0.18,0.801
i am trying to get solid frame rates at least 72 fps for playing no mans sky in vr through quest link on the oculus quest i have an i7 6700k rtx 2070 16gb ddr4 ram at 2197 mhz 800 watt psu and a crucial bx100 series ssd i upgraded from a gtx 970 to the 2070 and noticed improvement but the game still has issues maintaining smooth frame rates and gameplay needless to say i was disappointed that the 2070 didnt solve my issues completely as far as i can tell the main improvement from the 2070 to the 3070 is the increase in cores i was thinking that since it has double the cuda cores that it would solve my vr issues but since everything else is pretty much the same idk how much of a difference it will make would it be worth it to upgrade to a 2070 from a 3070 for this issue,0.068,0.821,0.111,0.8006
i loved the ending quote about being happy with the card you have now being a 60 series user i wanted a 3080 just to upgrade navi leak claims make it worth to wait for more info and partner cards for the 3070 come out,0.049,0.757,0.194,0.7964

i have a feeling amd is going to surprise the hell out of all of us that bought 308090s tomorrow still happy with getting a 3090 but im pretty sure these dates they are setting so close together are all competition moves tomorrow well see the 6800xt at 649 and then the 6900xt at 9491099 i dont think its a coincidence that the amd press conference is a day after the 3070 release 6900xt beating 3090 hoping not lol,0.107,0.688,0.205,0.7877
anyone else noted at 248 a little plume starts descending from top to bottom in front of steve was so gracious that i missed everything he said during that haha,0.069,0.669,0.262,0.7877
to be honest i have zero interest in watching this video for the actual card as the launch will just be another shitshow of incompetence watching this strictly to support gn you guys are doing gods work,0.073,0.681,0.246,0.7845

i was originally going to get a 2070 super glad i waited,0.0,0.504,0.496,0.7845
the 2060s power connector was the best it was a standard pin layout and it came out of the cards side the one on the 3070 is just retarded it comes out of the middle so it looks hideous but a great video,0.048,0.782,0.17,0.7845

good card wish i had horton the 6800xt instead but this is a very good midrange card,0.0,0.611,0.389,0.7684
personal opinion i do not really wish to know how a rtx 3070 compares to a rtx30803090 i honestly think that buying a second hand rtx2080 for 400 price area would be better option as for upcoming amd graphics card for me will depend on amd radeon releasing a driver only option or their usual bundle of breakware,0.042,0.806,0.153,0.7667
that depends on what you want it to do it does work well if what you want to do is cemu and some botw or super mario 3d with mild reshade effects with 8 core cpu and 32gb of system memory a similar performance to the amd rx 590 8gb with 4 core cpu and 16gb of system memory the core clocks of both are in the 15 ghz range,0.0,0.88,0.12,0.765

a bit off topic but those with amd cards and driver experience are the drivers still really worse than nvidias after years and years of the green side i might switch if amd has something good to offer but the driver story holds me back i really also like the tech on nvidias side like rtx and dlss but do i really need it maybe not,0.062,0.786,0.152,0.7647
i love the 3070 i dont think ill be upgrading for a while,0.0,0.551,0.449,0.7602

i have a dell u3818dw monitor 38 the native resolution is 3840 x 1600 60hz this seems to be not quite 4k but higher than 1440 and stuck at 60hz would an rtx 3070 be enough to run most games maxed out at my native resolution and refresh rate just a little confused if i really need an rtx 3080 thanks for the great review,0.071,0.794,0.135,0.7572

hey i was just wondering if the 3070 would be good for my pc which is an hp pavilion with i think 16gb ram amd ryzen 7 1700 processor and a radeon 550 rx 4gb graphics card i was thinking of buying the card tonight so i would like to hear your thoughts if i should get a new pc or if this pc i already have would be fine,0.0,0.886,0.114,0.7564
unlike 10 and 20series 30series 3080 looks a lot better than 3070 for its price they have very close priceperformance despite the price difference 3080 really is an impressive piece of tech,0.0,0.818,0.182,0.7553

i guess 3070 is not quite the 2080 ti killer for the most part but looking at the promises vs reality ratio we saw with 3080 makes it no surprise to anyone still seems like a pretty decent upgrade for my 1060 6gb its been kinda slow the only problem being in my country even the cheapest partner models of these cards cost over 600 euros and there is no fe version here definitely will wait for the new radeon cards to see if retailers will be less scummy with those or if by then prices do normalize a bit,0.101,0.752,0.147,0.7469

hey wow nobody can get their hands on these cards like very very few and by the time they are widely available they new 4000series will launch,0.0,0.799,0.201,0.743
they dont have plans to scalp their own product with the 3070 like they did with the 3080 in fact the latter card will see about 300000 units pumped into the market here shortly units that they had packaged on palettes back on september 17th with no intent to ship they wanted to see what amd was up to they wanted to see if they needed a quick refreshsuperti variant waiting in the wings they wanted the voucher program with aib partners to expire while leaving them hanging in several other areas as well and they wanted to drive hype so high that they push a large percentage of the consumers into impulsebuy mode even if the prices go up 20 people are sheep and will absolutely forgive nvidia and buy the things thus nvidia will never be forced to do things differently next time,0.015,0.922,0.063,0.7409
1605 these gaming charts are always valuable sitting on a gtx 1070 currently and really taking a hard look at the 30703080 since i was planning on building a new system this holiday season really will be interesting if big navi can be disruptive,0.083,0.727,0.191,0.736
for the mosfets it would be appreciated if you could provejustify that the vbios target thermals are actually unsafe for the card long term rather than just suggesting that nvidia could improve upon them,0.0,0.838,0.162,0.7351
the 3070 is the perfect 1440p card just like the 1070 and the 2070 before it,0.0,0.693,0.307,0.7351
seems like the perfect card for meee seeing as im not planning on get a 4k monitor for a whilleee and for the moment im still using a 1080p monitor until yk i get a 1440p,0.0,0.824,0.176,0.7351
the takeaway is that the 3070 is currently a paper launched like all the others and therefore overpriced 1440p card and dont think its quite a good enough upgrade from the 1080ti if youre trying to game at 4k not enough frame head room to go the distance youre right on the edge and thats with last gen games,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.7346
please dont waste your money proceeds to recommend 3070,0.0,0.457,0.543,0.7296
wouldnt be a waste for me xd im using a gtx 1550,0.0,0.566,0.434,0.7296
did nivida see the writing on the wall and thought to try and get the cards out and help break the market ice by lowering card prices i mean i am sure the price lowering was from multiple issues like adm new cards and solidify its place in the marektect but damn it feels like theyve gone out their way price wise,0.092,0.73,0.178,0.7269
im smart im still using a 970 on a 1080p monitor and it bloody works when i get a 3070 it will look like an actual upgrade anyone upgrading from a 20 series is a mong xd,0.075,0.694,0.231,0.7269

with only 8 gb of vram on the 3070 a used 2080ti looks like a much better buy,0.0,0.707,0.293,0.6597
i upgrated 2 months a go from an old gtx gigabyte 1070 to an msi rtw 3070 2x ventus for 1440p gaming and its really great paired with i5 12600 i had an gtx 1070 with i5 7600,0.0,0.883,0.117,0.659
as a casual consumer most of this goes in one ear and out the other which is probably to be expected but i really appreciate the depth of information you provide in these reviews,0.0,0.848,0.152,0.6586
if you are happy with the video card you have now there is no reason for you to upgrade just because something new came out hold on to it make the cards that you have last as long as you can and then upgrade when it really truely makes sense because you are unhappy with the performance you have is a good statement i have been running a pair of gtx660 cards for a few years now though have been thinking of upgrading to a pair of 1650 or similar i run two cards due to having a lot of monitors i dont run sli though some workstation tasks i work with could really make use of some more modern gpus but main reason i am interested in upgrading is to reduce system power consumption gets a bit toasty in summer,0.026,0.917,0.058,0.6542
it would be nice to have some indication of performance in msfs 2020 there must be many people like me looking to upgrade purely because of this game,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.6486
if the 3070 is still a little overkill for your typical 1080 1440p gamers what other card would you recommend that would be less expensive id prefer something from nvidia because id like to stream and want to use the encoder built into some nvidia cards so i am not maxing out my cpu,0.0,0.886,0.114,0.6486

can you look into nvidias oc scanner on these ampere cards itd be very interesting to see how the easiest overclocking option compares to the limited manual option this generation especially on cards like the rtx 3080 tuf or ftw3 with a good deal of thermal headroom but not much for power,0.026,0.834,0.14,0.6461
there are barely any games that utilize more then 8gb vram anyway so im not worryd besides i dont see a significant difference between 1440p and 4k i think a higher and constant refresh rate is more important then ridiculous high resolution but the 3080 is still about 20 to 40 faster and that is definitely worth paying 200 more,0.052,0.828,0.121,0.645

hey steve it would be really interesting if you could do ultrawide screen benchmarks someday ultrawides are in a weird position where they have more pixels than 1440p displays but less than 4k its really hard to figure out which card is the sweet spot with an ultrawide,0.065,0.821,0.114,0.5584

why do people say stuff like this card is too much for 1080p gaming   do you think that people who want to play rdr2 at 1080p are not worthy of good frame rates that in your mind they should buy a card based on other titles not demanding titles like ac rdr2 gr breakpoint horizon zero dawn or metro exodus or the new upcoming titles over the next two years,0.062,0.803,0.134,0.5505

noise normalized thermals isnt a good test unless its about sound vs thermal only blower designs are always noisier just because of the shape of the cooler id trade of noise for a blower design that would help ventilate my case preventing fans from ramping up in the first place it would be better to normalise this to air flow rate instead,0.054,0.86,0.086,0.4756

i am a little confused the 3070 has less rt cores than the 2080s if so how is it achieving a higher fps in rtx minecraft i mean i assume its because of the extra cuda cores but still feel like that cant be the full answer if it is then is this pointing to rt cores actually being kinda irrelevant in ray traced games,0.024,0.924,0.052,0.4111

i imagine the rtx 2080 ti will age better considering not only the higher vram but higher memory bandwidth,0.0,0.897,0.103,0.2382
i think 6800xt is the smart buy 16 gigs and 3080 performance plus all these cards with minimal vram 8gb 10gb keep us spending money every year or every other year even if you play 1080p games would grow into the performance peaks eventually so if your tired of paying so often go big and coast for awhile thats my plan im gonna overshoot and take a break from the spending grind my eyes are set on a 3080 tho gddr6x,0.038,0.901,0.061,0.235

overkill for 1080p how many new aaa games can this 3070 push to 144 or higher fps on high or ultra settings at 1080p and what happens if you turn on ray tracing overkill for 1080p yes but not for 1080p,0.0,0.956,0.044,0.2144

steve i have a gtx 980 reference card that i overclocked and is surprisingly not melting itself to death and still holds up decently i always think about what you say on ewaste when i look at newer gpus this year will probably be the last one for the card because its a fucking airplane but im happy i held on to it until i felt a real and logical reason to upgrade sometimes its hard to not get carried away by the moment and buy something that you think you need even tho its not entirely true,0.075,0.857,0.068,0.0713
hope i made the right choice getting this card at microcenter it was either get the 3070 now or wait and possibly get the 3080 in 2 hours when a truck comes i really wanted the 3080 i went ahead and bought the 3070 but i feel regret woulda felt like even more of a fool if i waited and they didnt have any 3080s either way i still dont know what was smarter,0.103,0.778,0.119,0.0599

what would be a good upgrade for 1080p then i am currently using a 1060 3gb with a 144hz monitor and its crashing due to low vram on titles such as warzone with low settings,0.12,0.798,0.083,-0.0772

i dont think 2080 ti users have anything to worry about here their cards are very overclockable compared to the 3070 with an overclock the 2080 ti pulls well ahead of the 3070 2080 ti owners overpaid for the card but i think they all knew that back when they bought it,0.038,0.932,0.03,-0.1027

the gtx 680 had a 195w tdp now the 3060 ti has a higher tdp of 200w it seems like nvidia is just faking how good their high end is by increasing power usage infinitely i mean 350w on the 3090 and spikes up to 400w on the 3080 is ridiculous my entire current rig with a gtx 1070 uses less than that in total by a large margin,0.096,0.829,0.076,-0.1027

its nice to see a review that takes the 3070s value into context even hardwareunboxed is comparing this card to the 1200 2080 ti which is a bad comparison as that card was terrible value and in no way represents what a card is supposed to cost,0.162,0.699,0.14,-0.296

saying you dont need a strong card to run 1080p titles is not correct once developers take advantage of the 3000 series processing power new games will be more demanding 3070s will be sweating their balls off even at 1080p,0.114,0.839,0.047,-0.4395

this is a strange video the 3070 is practically a 2080 ti and even that card was not the be all end all for pc gaming maybe at 1440p with a select few titles and you even mentioned how wolfenstein wasnt realistic and thats mainly because it had dlss on top of ray tracing not every game that has ray tracing will have dlss and ray tracing is just as demanding as it ever was and once the consoles actually try to implement it it will be more widespread on pc as well hell even a game like control at native 1440p can drop below 60fps in some areas on a 3080 the nextgen games arent even out yet but once the console games start finally maturing pc games will become more demanding as well on the hardware side so no a 3080 isnt a waste if you can actually get one even at 1440p,0.083,0.853,0.064,-0.4591
im really struggling to decide ive ordered a build with a 3080 10700k and 32gb ram im going to be streaming1080p 60 gaming and editing at 1440p 144hz would it make more sense to change it to the 3070 im also trying to future proof as much as i possibly can as this will probably be my last pc,0.053,0.947,0.0,-0.4754

theres nothing that this card cant do best price to performance,0.252,0.748,0.0,-0.5216
decided last generation that this grneration would be when i let go of my 980ti due to lack of gsync on freesync monitor support and other things that were cut off from the maxwell cards down the 980ti was more than capable as far as power but had hardware limitations such as display port and hdmi port revisioning which sucked,0.111,0.831,0.058,-0.5285
presumably the fans stop when set to 0 though right the software just doesnt support a slider with 0 and then an intermediate range that doesnt work ive never used a gpu with a 0rpm mode before so im just guessing,0.116,0.884,0.0,-0.5358
the lower capacity memory alongside the even lower than initially stated clock speed and bandwidth really makes me wonder just how long the 3070 will be sufficient to have the kind of 1440 and above resolution performance demonstrated on older titles benchmarked currently with the 3080 upwards from nvidia and what amd may potentially be pushing out as well developers are unlikely to lower their upper quality standards to accommodate the limitations of the 3070,0.083,0.891,0.026,-0.5423

its funny how nvidia made it so that no review will come out but the ones over the specific fe card which is not and will not be available anywhere else than northern america like always im quite pissed at nvidia for not letting us get information and feedback about the already vast stack of products that are really available for preorders worldwide compared to their homebrewed model that only a very few americans will get especially with this generation that pushes the intrinsic differences between fe and customs to a new level because as of now those reviews only concern a very very small portion of the target audience yet another example of nvidias despise of anyone outside of the uscan regardless of the fact that we europeans are in practice their best customers on both prices and volumes that is particularly frustrating in a context where preordering is probably the only way to get any card before next spring,0.087,0.85,0.062,-0.6562
sorry theres an error in the specs section we based it off of initial information from announcement but the final spec is actually 14gbps memory and 448gbs memory bandwidth that doesnt change any benchmark data our apologies for the error should have checked the final specs to see if they had changed teardown of rtx 3070 fe testing methodology,0.105,0.895,0.0,-0.6757
btw your performance will be lower with lower end cpus as this test is performed with 10900k many people have ryzen 5 3600 and similiar cpus so expect some bottleneck and lower fps,0.185,0.815,0.0,-0.6808
so far not impressed i will be impressed if there will be actual stock for the fe or any aib,0.249,0.751,0.0,-0.6844
i think the table is wrong for the memory on the 3070 it is 14gbps and so lower bandwidth at 448gbs not 16 and 512,0.213,0.787,0.0,-0.7155
i see what nvidia did so you were suppose to release the review a day before launch which is after amds announcement but they let you drop it a day earlier which is before the announcement so the made a amd blocking sandwich to try and draw some attention from them nvidia should focus on their supply instead,0.104,0.896,0.0,-0.7227
3070 or used 2080ti both cost the same in my area but i can get a 2080ti tomorrow if i wanted yes i know one will have warranty and the other wont i tried to get a 3080 and failed i tried to get a 6800xt and failed i dont have many options left,0.163,0.771,0.065,-0.7469
i would like a 3070 but i i run a 3440x1440 monitor and i think just 8gb vram its an limitation for me because in some games my fps might suffer and i want to keep my gpu for years to come maybe now its okish but 34 years laterseh,0.152,0.784,0.064,-0.7469
how does the 3070 fe does in the nzxt h1 i was able to get the fe but no i am a bit discouraged to slot it in after watching your 3080 fe in nzxt h1 video,0.166,0.834,0.0,-0.7469
we are gonna need benchmarks of time of launch verses median time to actually acquire one of these cards ive never seen a company mismanage hype so bad hype is a tool to make people stop thinking rationally people always want the new shiny and if you let them think about it they might realize they dont really need the new shiny and buy something else entirely basic stuff here nvidia,0.09,0.892,0.018,-0.75
honestly i was really hyped for this 3000 series especially after the initial announcement back in september as id really like to upgrade my pascal but this launch is just awful and hope amd will punish nvidia for this flop,0.231,0.623,0.146,-0.7564
i sold my rtx 3090 for the rougly the same price i bought it i was not comfortable sitting on an so so overpriced piece of hardware in my pc i bought a 3070 tuf oc for less then half the price performance dropped around 20 but guess what i dont care anymore i play on 1440p anyway,0.141,0.859,0.0,-0.7812
i ve still got a 1080ti in my build just upgraded everything but kept the gpu contemplating getting the 3070 but would rather spend 200 more bones on a 3080 if they were ever available another problem is i m fully water cooled so i would have to find a block for whatever gpu i buy and the options look scarce atm,0.125,0.875,0.0,-0.8126
considering my 1080 just died on me and that i needed a full upgrade that 3070 seems nice ill be waiting for amd now price war and all,0.293,0.627,0.08,-0.8176
lets see the partner cards will be released in 23 days but will actually be available in 23 months from now got it i really wanted to be excited for the 3000 series launches but the way nvidia has messed up the 3080 3090 launches and the costs of all of the cards released so far makes me feel completely meh about the entire launch not everyone has has 500 to spend on a new card especially with a lot of people losing their jobs or having to take pay cuts this year in order to keep their job,0.121,0.85,0.029,-0.8266
on the die isnt the ga104 a completely different die rather than a cutdown version of the 3080 and 3090s ga102,0.315,0.685,0.0,-0.8316
currently using a dual 1060 6gb from asus i need to upgrade badly but i cant afford to buy the 3070 as a place holder just to upgrade to the 3090 i actually want later 1800 bucks is a shit ton of money for me even if the damned cards were available so i cant justify spending 500 or 600 on card now that i dont really want just to have something until i can get the one i do want,0.13,0.816,0.055,-0.8402
