it fit in my nzxt h11 mini itx build and i could overclock it though havent yet due to me not having bought a 1440p monitor yet so im bottlenecked by my cpu atm but it handles tarkov well enough and cheaper than a new 3090 on amazon,0.0,0.867,0.133,0.6652

i ordered it came as expected everything in the box and 1 week laster the power connector cables started to burn i took it out and they were black and burned so i sent it back not buying from this manufacturer againbutwhen it did work it ran everything at top level except for cyberpunk ps buy either a 1000w or 1300w power supply for this thing,0.0,0.971,0.029,0.2023
card works perfectly well works well under stress and not a sound and games run over hundred frames per second with 1440p i don t know what s the hate behind it but it s affordable for 850 comes overclocked and has the firestorm software because of zotac that monitors cards and updates you can t ask for more than that,0.071,0.834,0.095,0.1154
