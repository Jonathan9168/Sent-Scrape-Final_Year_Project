    <h2>Interpreting Vader Graph</h2>
    <p>
      Vader Is 'A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social
      Media Text' (Hutto, C.J. & Gilbert, E.E. 2014) made available through
      NLTK's Python library. <br />
      <br />
      Vader's scoring comprises of four values (<span style="color: lightgreen"
        >pos</span
      >, <span style="color: #f98686">neg</span>,
      <span style="color: #fcba03">neu</span>,
      <span style="color: lightblue">compound</span>) with values ranging from
      -1 ➜ 1.
      <br />
      <br />
      <span style="color: lightgreen">pos</span> - Refers to the positivity of a
      comment. Ranges from 0 - 1. The closer the positivity score to one, the
      more positive the opinion. <br />
      <br />
      <span style="color: #f98686">neg</span> - Refers to the negativity of a
      comment. Ranges from 0 - 1. The closer the negativity score to one, the
      harsher the opinion. <br /><br />
      <span style="color: #fcba03">neu</span> - Refers to the neutrality of a
      comment. Ranges from 0 - 1. The closer the neutrality score to one, the
      greater the inconclusiveness. <br /><br />
      <span style="color: lightblue">compound</span> - Refers to the overall
      mood of a comment. Ranges from -1 ➜ 1. The closer the compound score to
      one, the more a comment was overall deemed positive. Therefore greater
      noise on the LHS of a graph versus the RHS indicates a skew toward overall
      negativity. See Firgure 1.0<br /><br />

    <h2>Interpreting roBERTa Graph</h2>
    <p>
      'This is a roBERTa-base model trained on ~124M tweets from January 2018 to
      December 2021 and finetuned for sentiment analysis with the TweetEval
      benchmark.' (Hugging Face, 2021)
    </p>
    roBERTa's scoring comprises of three values (<span style="color: lightgreen"
      >pos</span
    >, <span style="color: #f98686">neg</span>,
    <span style="color: #fcba03">neu</span>) with values ranging from 0 ➜ 1.
    <br /><br />
    <span style="color: lightgreen">pos</span> - Refers to the positivity of a
    comment. Ranges from 0 - 1. The closer the positivity score to one, the more
    positive the opinion. <br />
    <br />
    <span style="color: #f98686">neg</span> - Refers to the negativity of a
    comment. Ranges from 0 - 1. The closer the negativity score to one, the
    harsher the opinion. <br /><br />
    <span style="color: #fcba03">neu</span> - Refers to the neutrality of a
    comment. Ranges from 0 - 1. The closer the neutrality score to one, the
    greater the inconclusiveness.<br /><br />
    Figure 1.1 shows significant noise on the RHS for the negativity scores
    indicating mostly negative comments. The noise on the LHS for low scoring
    positivity scores reinforces this. <br /><br />
